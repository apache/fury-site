And we can also encode the meta into binary in advance, and use one memory copy to write it which will be much faster.\\n\\n### Serialize data\\n\\n```java\\n  public static class NumericStruct {\\n

often need to send **`namespace/path/filename/fieldName/packageName/moduleName/className/enumValue`** string between processes.\\n\\nThose strings are mostly ascii strings. In order to transfer between processes, we encode such strings using utf-8 encodings. Such encoding\\nwill take one byte for every char, which is not space efficient actually.\\n\\nIf we take a deeper look, we will found that most chars are **lowercase chars,  `.`, `$` and `_`**, which can be expressed in a much\\nsmaller range **`0~32`**. But one byte can represent range `0~255`, the significant bits are wasted, and this cost is not ignorable. In a dynamic serialization\\nframework, such meta will take considerable cost compared to actual data.\\n\\nSo we proposed a new string encoding algorithm which we called **meta string encoding** in Fury. It will encode most chars using `5` bits instead of `8` bits in utf-8 encoding, which can bring **37.5% space cost savings** compared to utf-8 encoding.\\n\\n## Meta String Introduction\\n\\nMeta string encoding algorithm is mainly used to encode meta strings such as **field names, namespace, packageName, className, path and filename**.\\nSuch a string is enumerated and limited, so the encoding performance is not important since we can cache the encoding result.\\n\\nMeta string encoding uses `5/6` bits instead of `8` bits in utf-8 encoding for every chars. Since it uses less bits than utf8, it can bring\\n**37.5% space cost savings** compared to utf-8 and has a smaller encoded binary size, which uses less storage and makes the network transfer faster.\\n\\nMore details about meta string spec can be found in [Fury xlang serialization specification](https://fury.apache.org/docs/specification/fury_xlang_serialization_spec/#meta-string).\\n\\n## Encoding Algorithms\\n\\nString binary encoding algorithm:\\n\\n| Algorithm                 | Pattern       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\\n|---------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| LOWER_SPECIAL             | `a-z._$\\\\|`    | every char is written using 5 bits, `a-z`: `0b00000~0b11001`, `._$\\\\|`: `0b11010~0b11101`, prepend one bit at the start to indicate whether strip last char since last byte may have 7 redundant bits(1 indicates strip last char)                                                        |\\n| LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL | `a-zA-Z0~9._` | every char is written using 6 bits, `a-z`: `0b00000~0b11001`, `A-Z`: `0b11010~0b110011`, `0~9`: `0b110100~0b111101`, `._`: `0b111110~0b111111`,  prepend one bit at the start to indicate whether strip last char since last byte may have 7 redundant bits(1 indicates strip last char) |\\n| UTF-8                     | any chars     | UTF-8 encoding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\\n\\nIf we use `LOWER_SPECIAL/LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL`, we must add a strip last char flag in encoded data.

If there are multiple uppercase chars, then `ALL_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL` will be used instead.\\nIf a string contains digits, then `LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL` will be used.\\n\\nFinally, utf8 will be the fallback encoding if the string contains some chars which is not in range `a-z0-9A-Z`.\\n\\n## Encoding Flags and Data jointly\\n\\n- Depending on the case, one can choose encoding `flags + data` jointly, using 3 bits of first byte for flags and other bytes for data. This can be useful since there are some holes remaining in last byte, adding flags in data doesn\'t always increase serialized bytes size.\\n- Or one can use a header to encode such flags with other meta such as encoded size, this is what Fury does in https://github.com/apache/fury/pull/1556\\n\\n## Benchmark\\n\\nutf8 encoding uses `30` bytes for string `org.apache.fury.benchmark.data`, fury meta string uses only `19` bytes.\\nutf8 encoding uses `12` bytes for string `MediaContent`, but fury meta string uses only `9` bytes.\\n\\n```java\\n// utf8 use 30 bytes, we use only 19 bytes\\nassertEquals(encoder.encode(\\"org.apache.fury.benchmark.data\\").getBytes().length, 19);\\n// utf8 uses 12 bytes, we use only 9 bytes.\\nassertEquals(encoder.encode(\\"MediaContent\\").getBytes().length, 9);\\n```"},{"id":"fury_0_5_0_release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/fury_0_5_0_release","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/fury-site/tree/main/blog/2024-05-03-fury_0_5_0_release.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-03-fury_0_5_0_release.md","title":"Fury v0.5.0 Released","description":"We\'re excited to announce the release of Fury v0.5.0.

The performance and ease-of-use of serialization affects **runtime and development efficiency** of the system.\\n\\nStatic serialization frameworks like [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) or [FlatBuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers) cannot be used for cross-language [application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) directly, because they **don\'t support shared reference and polymorphism**, and also need to **generate code ahead**.\\n\\nDynamic serialization frameworks such as JDK serialization, Kryo, Fst, Hessian, Pickle provide ease-of-use and dynamics, but **don\'t support cross-language** and suffer significant **performance issues**, which is unsuitable for high throughput, low latency, and large-scale data transfer scenarios.\\n\\nTherefore, we developed a new multi-language serialization framework **Apache Fury**, which is open-sourced on https://github.com/apache/fury. Through **highly optimized serialization primitives, JIT dynamic compilation and zero-copy** technologies, Fury is both fast and easy-to-use. It can **cross-language serialize any object automatically** and provides **ultimate performance** at the same time.\\n\\n<p>\\n<img width=\\"44%\\" alt=\\"serialization\\" src=\\"/img/case1.png\\" />\\n<img  width=\\"44%\\" alt=\\"deserialization\\" src=\\"/img/case2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## What is Apache Fury?\\n\\nApache Fury is a multi-language serialization framework powered by JIT dynamic compilation and zero copy, providing blazing\\nfast speed and ease of use:\\n\\n- **Multiple languages**: Java, Python, C++, Golang, JavaScript, Rust. Other languages can be added easily.\\n- **Highly optimized serialization primitives**.\\n- **Zero-copy**: Support [out-of-band](https://peps.python.org/pep-0574/) serialization and off-heap read/write.\\n- **High performance**: Use JIT to generate serialization code at runtime in an async multithreaded way, which can optimize methods inlining, code cache, dead code elimination, hash lookup, meta writing and memory read/write.\\n- **Multi protocols**: Provide flexibility and ease of use of dynamic serialization, as well as the cross-language of static serialization.\\n  - **Java Serialization**:\\n    - Drop-in replaces JDK, Kryo, and Hessian. No need to modify user code, but providing 170x speed up at most, which can improve efficiency of rpc, data transfer and object persistence significantly.\\n    - 100% JDK compatible, support JDK custom serialization methods `writeObject`, `readObject`, `writeReplace`, `readResolve`, `readObjectNoData` natively.\\n  - **Cross-language object graph**:\\n    - Cross-language serialize any objects automatically, no need for IDL, schema compilation, and object/protocol conversion.\\n    - Cross-language serialize shared/circular reference, no data duplication or recursion error.\\n    - Support object polymorphism, multiple children type objects can be serialized simultaneously.\\n  - **Row format**\\n    - A cache-friendly binary random-access format, supports skipping deserialization and lazy deserialization, efficient for high-performance computing and large-scale data transfer.\\n    - Support automatic conversion to Apache Arrow.\\n\\n## Core Serialization Capabilities\\n\\nAlthough different scenarios require different serialization protocols, the underlying operations of serialization are\\nsimilar.\\n\\nTherefore, Fury defines and implements **a set of basic serialization capabilities**, which can be used for quickly building new multi-language serialization protocols and get speedup by JIT acceleration and other optimizations.\\n\\nAt the same time, performance optimization for a protocol on the primitives can also benefit all other protocols.\\n\\n### Serialization Primitives\\n\\nCommon serialization operations contains:\\n\\n- Bitmap operations\\n- Number encoding and decoding\\n- Compression for int and long\\n- String creation and copy\\n- String encoding: ASCII, UTF8, UTF16\\n- Memory copy\\n- Array copy and compression\\n- Meta encoding, compression, and cache\\n\\nFury use SIMD and other advanced language features to make basic operations extremely fast in every languages.\\n\\n### Zero-copy Serialization\\n\\nLarge-scale data transfer often has multiple binary buffers in an object graph. Some serialization frameworks will write the binaries into an intermediate buffer and introduce multiple time-consuming memory copies. Fury implemented an **out-of-band serialization protocol** inspired by [pickle5](https://peps.python.org/pep-0574/), Ray and Apache Arrow, which can **capture all binary buffers** in an object graph to avoid intermediate copies of these buffers.\\n\\nThe following figure shows the serialization process of zero-copy:\\n\\n<img alt=\\"fury zero copy\\" src=\\"/img/fury_zero_copy.jpeg\\" />\\n\\nCurrently, Fury supports the following types of zero-copy:\\n\\n- Java: all basic types of arrays, `ByteBuffer`, `ArrowRecordBatch`, and `VectorSchemaRoot`\\n- Python: all arrays of the array module, numpy arrays, `pyarrow.Table`, and `pyarrow.RecordBatch`\\n- Golang: byte slice\\n\\nYou can also add the new zero copy type based on the Fury interface.\\n\\n### JIT dynamic compilation acceleration\\n\\nCustom type objects usually contain lots of type information, Fury used this information to generate efficient serialization code at runtime, which can push lots of runtime operations into the dynamic compilation stage. By inlining more methods, better code cache, reducing virtual method calls, conditional branches, hash lookup, metadata writes, and memory reads/writes, the serialization performance is greatly accelerated.\\n\\nFor Java, Fury implements a **runtime codegen framework** and defines an [operator expression IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation). Then fury can perform type inference based on the generic type information of the object at runtime to build an expression tree that describes the logic of serialized code.\\n\\nThe codegen framework will generate efficient Java code from the expression tree, then pass to [Janino](https://github.com/janino-compiler/janino) to compile it into bytecode, and load it into the user\'s ClassLoader or the ClassLoader created by Fury, and finally compile it into efficient assembly code through Java JIT.\\n\\nSince JVM JIT skips Big method compilation and inlining, Fury also implements an optimizer to **split big methods into small methods recursively**, thus ensuring that all code can be compiled and inlined.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"fury java codegen\\" src=\\"/img/fury_java_codegen.png\\" />\\n\\nFury also supports **asynchronous multithreaded compilation** by running the codegen tasks in a thread pool, and using interpretation mode until JIT finishes to ensure no serialization burrs. Users can skip warm up serialization of objects.\\n\\nPython and JavaScript codegen are similar. Generating source code is easier for development and troubleshooting problems.\\n\\nSince serialization will manipulate objects extensively in each programming language, and the language does not expose the low-level API of the memory model, native methods call has a large cost too, so we cannot use [LLVM](https://www.llvm.org/) to build a unified serializer JIT framework. Instead, we implemented a codegen framework for every language separately.\\n\\n### Static code generation\\n\\nAlthough JIT compilation can greatly improve serialization efficiency and generate better serialization code based on the statistical distribution of data at runtime, languages like C++ do not support reflection, have no virtual machines, and no low-level API for memory models. We cannot generate serialization code dynamically for such languages through JIT.\\n\\nIn such scenarios, Fury is implementing an **AOT codegen framework**, which generates the serialized code statically according to the object schema, and objects can be serialized automatically using the generated serializer. For Rust, Rust macro is used to generate code statically.\\n\\n### Cache optimization\\n\\nWhen serializing a custom type, fury will **reorder fields** to ensure that fields of the same type are serialized in order. This can hit more data cache and CPU instruction cache.\\n\\nThe basic type fields are written **in descending order by byte size**. In this way, if the initial addresses are aligned, subsequent read and write operations will occur at the position where the memory addresses are aligned, making CPU execution more efficient.\\n\\n## Multi-protocol Design and Implementation\\n\\nBased on the multi-language serialization features provided by Fury core, we have built three serialization protocols for different scenarios:\\n\\n- **Java serialization**: Suitable for pure Java serialization scenarios and provides up to 170x speed up;\\n- **Cross-language object graph serialization**: Suitable for application-oriented multi-language programming and\\n  high-performance cross-language serialization;\\n- **Row-format serialization**: Suitable for distributed computing engines such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Apache Doris, Velox, and features frameworks.\\n\\nIn the future, we will add new protocols for other core scenarios. Users can also build their own protocols based on Fury\'s serialization framework.\\n\\n### Java serialization\\n\\nJava is widely used in **big data, cloud native, microservices, and enterprise applications**. Therefore, Fury made lots of optimizations for Java serialization, which reduces system latency and server costs a lot, and improves throughput significantly. Our implementation has the following highlights:\\n\\n- Blazing fast performance: Based on Java types, JIT compilation and Unsafe low-level operations, **Fury is 170x faster than JDK, and 50~110x faster than Kryo/Hessian** at most.\\n- **100% JDK serialization API compatibility** : Supports all JDK custom serialization methods `writeObject`, `readObject`, `writeReplace`, `readResolve`, `readObjectNoData` natively to ensure the serialization correctness in any scenario. Kryo and Hessian have some correctness issues in these scenarios.\\n- **Type compatibility**: When the deserialization and serialization class schema are inconsistent, it can still deserialize correctly. It supports application upgrade and deployment, add/delete fields independently. Fury type-compatible mode is implemented with no performance loss compared to type-consistent mode.\\n- **Metadata sharing** : share metadata(class name, field name&type, etc.) across multiple serializations under a context (TCP connection), meta will be sent to the peer only for the first serialization, the peer can reconstruct the same deserializer based on this information. Subsequent serialization will skip transferring metadata, which can reduce network traffic, and support type compatibility automatically.\\n- **Zero-copy support**: supports out-of-band zero copy and off-heap memory read and write.\\n\\n### Cross-language object graph serialization\\n\\nFury cross-language object graph serialization is primarily used for scenarios that require higher dynamics and ease-of-use.\\n\\nAlthough frameworks like Protobuf or FlatBuffers support cross-language serialization, they still have limitations:\\n\\n- They require **pre-defined IDLs and generate code statically ahead**, lacking sufficient dynamics and flexibility;\\n- The generated classes **don\'t conform to object-oriented design** and it\'s impossible to add behavior to classes, which make them unsuitable for use as domain objects in cross-language application development.\\n- They **don\'t support polymorphism**. Object-oriented programming uses interfaces to invoke subclass methods, but this pattern isn\'t supported well in those frameworks. Although FlatBuffers offers `Union`, and Protobuf provides `OneOf/Any`, those API require check object type during serialization and deserialization, which isn\'t polymorphic.\\n- They **don\'t support circular references and shared references**. Users need to define a set of IDLs for domain objects\\n  and implement reference resolution by themselves, as well as writing code to convert between domain objects and protocol objects in each language. If the object graph depth is deep, more code needs to be written.\\n\\nDue to the above limitations, Fury implemented a cross-language object graph serialization protocol that:\\n\\n- **Automatically serializes any object across multiple languages**: By defining classes in the serialization and deserialization peer, objects in one language can be automatically serialized into objects in another language without creating IDL files, compiling schema to generate code, or writing conversion code.\\n- **Automatically serializes shared and circular references** across multiple languages.\\n- **Supports object type polymorphism**, consistent with the object-oriented programming paradigm, and multiple subtypes can be automatically deserialized without manual intervention.\\n- **Out-of-band zero-copy** is also supported in this protocol.\\n\\nExample of Automatic Cross-Language Serialization:\\n\\n<img alt=\\"xlang serialization example\\" src=\\"/img/xlang_serialization_example.png\\" />\\n\\n### Row-format\\n\\nFor **high-performance computing and large-scale data transfer** scenarios, data serialization and transfer are often the **performance bottlenecks** of the system. If users only need to read part of the data or filter data based on some field of an object, deserializing the entire data will result in unnecessary overhead. Therefore, Fury provides a binary data structure for **direct reading and writing on binary data to avoid serialization**.\\n\\n[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a standardized columnar storage format that supports binary read and write. However, **columnar format is not suitable for all scenarios**. Data in online and streaming computing are naturally stored row by row, and row is also used in columnar computing engines when involving data updates, Hash/Join/Aggregation operations.\\n\\nHowever, there is no standardized implementation for row format. **Computing engines such as Spark/Flink/Doris/Velox all defined their row format, which doesn\'t support cross-language and can only be used internally by themselves**. FlatBuffers does support **lazy deserialization**, but it requires static compilation of schema IDL and management of offset, which is impossible for complex scenarios.\\n\\nTherefore, Fury implemented a **binary row format** inspired by [Spark Tungsten](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/28/project-tungsten-bringing-spark-closer-to-bare-metal.html) and [Apache Arrow format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html), which allows **random access and partial deserialization**. Currently, Java/Python/C++ versions have been implemented, allowing direct reading and writing on binary data to avoid all serialization overhead, and can convert to arrow format automatically.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"xlang serialization example\\" src=\\"/img/row_format.png\\" />\\n\\nThis format is densely stored, byte aligned and cache-friendly, which enables faster read and write operations. By avoiding deserialization, it reduces Java GC pressure and Python overhead. Based on Python\'s dynamics, Fury\'s data structure implements special methods such as `getattr`, `getitem`, `slice`, etc., ensuring behavior consistency with Python `dataclass`, `list`, `object`, and users have no perception of this.\\n\\n## Performance Comparison\\n\\nHere are some Java serialization performance data, where charts with \\"compatible\\" in the title are performance data under type compatible mode: Support type forward vs. Backward compatibility. Charts without \\"compatible\\" in the title are performance data without type compatibility: class schema must be same between serialization and deserialization.\\n\\nFor fairness, Fury disabled the zero-copy feature for all tests.\\n\\n<p>\\n<img width=\\"44%\\" alt=\\"serialization\\" src=\\"/img/case1.png\\" />\\n<img  width=\\"44%\\" alt=\\"deserialization\\" src=\\"/img/case2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n<img width=\\"44%\\" alt=\\"bench_serialize_compatible_MEDIA_CONTENT_to_array_tps\\" src=\\"/img/benchmarks/serialization/bench_serialize_compatible_MEDIA_CONTENT_to_array_tps.png\\" />\\n<img width=\\"44%\\" alt=\\"bench_deserialize_compatible_MEDIA_CONTENT_from_array_tps\\" src=\\"/img/benchmarks/deserialization/bench_deserialize_compatible_MEDIA_CONTENT_from_array_tps.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n<img width=\\"44%\\" alt=\\"bench_serialize_STRUCT_to_array_tps\\" src=\\"/img/benchmarks/serialization/bench_serialize_STRUCT_to_array_tps.png\\" />\\n<img width=\\"44%\\" alt=\\"bench_serialize_SAMPLE_to_array_tps\\" src=\\"/img/benchmarks/serialization/bench_serialize_SAMPLE_to_array_tps.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\n- Meta compression, auto meta sharing and cross-language schema compatibility.\\n- AOT Framework for C++ and Golang to generate code statically.\\n- Object graph serialization support for C++ and Rust\\n- Row format support for Golang, Rust, and NodeJS\\n- Protobuf compatibility support\\n- Protocols for features and knowledge graph serialization\\n- Continuously improve our serialization infrastructure for any new protocols\\n\\n## Join us\\n\\nWe are committed to building Apache Fury into an open and neutral community project that pursues passion and innovation.

Fury will generate highly-optimized serializer by generate serialize code at runtime to speed up serializaiton. The serialization for those objects will be extremely fast.\\n\\nFor a long time, scala serialization is always tricky, only reliable way is JDK serialization. But it\u2019s too slow, and the serialized size is too large. Although we have frameworks such as chill, but the support for scala types are limited, and the performance is limited too.Now with fury scala, you can serialize any scala objects you want and get extremly fast performance. Please try it out and let us know if you have any issues.\\n\\n## Scala Serialization Guide\\n\\nInstall dependecy:\\n\\n```sbt\\nlibraryDependencies += \\"org.furyio\\" % \\"fury-core\\" % \\"0.3.0\\"\\n```\\n\\nCreating fury:\\n\\n```scala\\nval fury = Fury.builder()\\n .withScalaOptimizationEnabled(true)\\n .requireClassRegistration(false)\\n .withRefTracking(true)\\n .build()\\n```\\n\\nSerialize case objects:\\n\\n```scala\\ncase class Person(github: String, age: Int, id: Long)\\nval p = Person(\\"https://github.com/chaokunyang\\", 18, 1)\\nprintln(fury.deserialize(fury.serialize(p)))\\nprintln(fury.deserializeJavaObject(fury.serializeJavaObject(p)))\\n```\\n\\nSerialize singleton objects:\\n\\n```scala\\nobject singleton {\\n}\\nval o1 = fury.deserialize(fury.serialize(singleton))\\nval o2 = fury.deserialize(fury.serialize(singleton))\\nprintln(o1 == o2)\\n```\\n\\nSerialize collection objects:\\n\\n```scala\\nval seq = Seq(1,2)\\nval list = List(\\"a\\", \\"b\\") val map = Map(\\"a\\" -> 1, \\"b\\" -> 2)\\nprintln(fury.deserialize(fury.serialize(seq)))\\nprintln(fury.deserialize(fury.serialize(list)))\\nprintln(fury.deserialize(fury.serialize(map)))\\n```\\n\\nSerialize enum:\\n\\n```scala\\nenum Color { case Red, Green, Blue }\\nprintln(fury.deserialize(fury.serialize(Color.Green)))\\n```\\n\\n## Highlight\\n\\n- [Scala] Support scala serialization: `case/object/tuple/string/collection/enum/basic` all supported\\n- [Scala] Add [scala user documentation](https://github.com/alipay/fury/blob/main/docs/guide/scala_guide.md)\\n- [Scala] add optimized scala singleton object serializer\\n- [Java] Make `java.io.Externalizable` compatible with Java `writeReplace/readResolve` API\\n- [Java] Integrate fury with dubbo https://github.com/apache/dubbo-spi-extensions/pull/226\\n- [Java] support bytes string serialization for jdk8 with JDK17 runtime\\n\\n## BugFix\\n\\n- [Java] Allow for `InputStream` not reading entire length\\n- [Java] Use `ReflectionUtils.getCtrHandle()` for non-public constructor in `ExternalizableSerializer`\\n- [Java] fix jdk compatible serialization for inheritance\\n\\n## What\'s Changed\\n\\n- [Impove]-[Doc] Improve README by @caicancai in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1011\\n- [Java] rename wrong ascii naming to latin by @chaokunyang in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1013\\n- [Doc] Update go install doc by @chaokunyang in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1015\\n- fix(grammatical): correct typos and improve grammar by @iamahens in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1018\\n- [Improve]-[Doc] Improve README by @caicancai in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1020\\n- [Improve]-[Doc] add environment requirement by @caicancai in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1022\\n- chore(docs): fixed typos by @Smoothieewastaken in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1023\\n- bugfix: read buffer error when object contain binary field by @wangweipeng2 in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1026\\n- [Doc] Optimize class registration doc by @chaokunyang in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1027\\n- [Java] fix jdk compatible serialization for inheritance by @chaokunyang in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1030\\n- [Doc] add scala user doc by @chaokunyang in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1028\\n- [Doc] refine scala doc by @chaokunyang in https://github.com/alipay/fury/pull/1031\\n- Update README.md -
