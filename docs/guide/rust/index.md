**Apache Fory™** is a blazing fast multi-language serialization framework powered by **JIT compilation** and **zero-copy** techniques, providing up to **ultra-fast performance** while maintaining ease of use and safety.

The Rust implementation provides versatile and high-performance serialization with automatic memory management and compile-time type safety. It supports both xlang mode for cross-language payloads and native mode for Rust-only payloads.

## Why Apache Fory™ Rust?

- **Fast binary encoding**: Zero-copy deserialization and optimized binary protocols
- **Xlang**: Seamlessly serialize/deserialize data across Java, Python, C++,
  Go, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Swift, Dart, Scala, and Kotlin
- **Type-safe**: Compile-time type checking with derive macros
- **Circular references**: Automatic tracking of shared and circular references with `Rc`/`Arc` and weak pointers
- **Polymorphic**: Serialize trait objects with `Box<dyn Trait>`, `Rc<dyn Trait>`, and `Arc<dyn Trait>`
- **Schema evolution**: Compatible mode for independent schema changes
- **Two formats**: Object graph serialization and zero-copy row-based format

## Crates

| Crate                                                                       | Description                                               | Version                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [`fory`](https://github.com/apache/fory/blob/main/rust/fory)                | User-facing API, runtime types, and derive macros         | [1.4.0](https://crates.io/crates/fory)        |
| [`fory-core`](https://github.com/apache/fory/blob/main/rust/fory-core/)     | Lower-level runtime crate for advanced integrations       | [1.4.0](https://crates.io/crates/fory-core)   |
| [`fory-derive`](https://github.com/apache/fory/blob/main/rust/fory-derive/) | Lower-level procedural macro crate for direct runtime use | [1.4.0](https://crates.io/crates/fory-derive) |

Most applications should depend on `fory` only. It re-exports the derive
macros and the public runtime types needed by generated code. Use `fory-core`
or `fory-derive` directly only when intentionally building on the lower-level
runtime crates.

## Quick Start

Add Apache Fory™ to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
fory = "1.4.0"
```

### Basic Example

```rust
use fory::{Fory, Error, Reader};
use fory::ForyStruct;

#[derive(ForyStruct, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct User {
    name: String,
    age: i32,
    email: String,
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let mut fory = Fory::builder().xlang(true).build();
    fory.register::<User>(1)?;

    let user = User {
        name: "Alice".to_string(),
        age: 30,
        email: "alice@example.com".to_string(),
    };

    // Serialize
    let bytes = fory.serialize(&user)?;
    // Deserialize
    let decoded: User = fory.deserialize(&bytes)?;
    assert_eq!(user, decoded);

    // Serialize to specified buffer
    let mut buf: Vec<u8> = vec![];
    fory.serialize_to(&mut buf, &user)?;
    // Deserialize from specified buffer
    let mut reader = Reader::new(&buf);
    let decoded: User = fory.deserialize_from(&mut reader)?;
    assert_eq!(user, decoded);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Xlang Mode And Native Mode

Use xlang mode for cross-language payloads and schemas shared with other Fory implementations. Xlang mode is the default Rust wire mode, and Rust examples that use it set `.xlang(true)` explicitly so the mode choice is visible.

Use native mode for Rust-only traffic. Native mode is selected with `.xlang(false)` and keeps Rust object serialization in Rust-native form. It is optimized for Rust's type system and covers Rust-specific object features such as trait objects and shared-reference patterns that are not portable xlang payloads. Compatible mode is enabled by default. Set `.compatible(false)` only when every reader and writer uses the same Rust schema and you want faster serialization and smaller size.

See [Xlang Serialization](xlang-serialization.md) for Rust xlang registration and interoperability rules, and [Native Serialization](native-serialization.md) for Rust-only payloads.

## Thread Safety

Apache Fory™ Rust is fully thread-safe: `Fory` implements both `Send` and `Sync`, so one configured instance can be shared across threads for concurrent work. The internal read/write context pools are lazily initialized with thread-safe primitives, letting worker threads reuse buffers without coordination.

```rust
use fory::{Fory, Error};
use fory::ForyStruct;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

#[derive(ForyStruct, Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Item {
    value: i32,
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let mut fory = Fory::builder().xlang(true).build();
    fory.register::<Item>(1000)?;

    let fory = Arc::new(fory);
    let handles: Vec<_> = (0..8)
        .map(|i| {
            let shared = Arc::clone(&fory);
            thread::spawn(move || {
                let item = Item { value: i };
                shared.serialize(&item)
            })
        })
        .collect();

    for handle in handles {
        let bytes = handle.join().unwrap()?;
        let item: Item = fory.deserialize(&bytes)?;
        assert!(item.value >= 0);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Tip:** Perform registrations (such as `fory.register::<T>(id)`) before spawning threads so every worker sees the same metadata. Once configured, wrapping the instance in `Arc` is enough to fan out serialization and deserialization tasks safely.

## Architecture

The Rust implementation consists of three main crates:

```
fory/                   # High-level API
├── src/lib.rs         # Public API exports

fory-core/             # Core serialization engine
├── src/
│   ├── fory.rs       # Main serialization entry point
│   ├── buffer.rs     # Binary buffer management
│   ├── serializer/   # Type-specific serializers
│   ├── resolver/     # Type resolution and metadata
│   ├── meta/         # Meta string compression
│   ├── row/          # Row format implementation
│   └── types.rs      # Type definitions

fory-derive/           # Procedural macros
├── src/
│   ├── object/       # ForyStruct macro
│   └── fory_row.rs  # ForyRow macro
```
