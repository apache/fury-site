This page covers Rust Fory instance configuration. `Fory::builder().xlang(true).build()` selects xlang mode with
compatible schema evolution. Native mode is selected explicitly with `.xlang(false)` and also defaults to
compatible schema evolution.

## Wire Modes

Apache Fory™ supports two serialization modes:

### Xlang Mode

Xlang mode is selected with `.xlang(true)` and uses the cross-language wire
format. Compatible schema evolution is the xlang default and is recommended for
cross-language services because schemas can diverge more easily across
languages:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().xlang(true).build();
```

Use `.compatible(false)` for xlang payloads only when every reader and writer always uses the same schema and you want faster serialization and smaller size. Use it only after verifying that every language uses that schema, or when native types are generated from Fory schema IDL:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().compatible(false).build();
```

### Native Mode

For Rust-only payloads, select native mode explicitly:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().xlang(false).build();
```

Compatible mode is enabled by default. Set `.compatible(false)` only when every reader and
writer always uses the same Rust schema and you want faster serialization and smaller size.

## Configuration

### Maximum Dynamic Object Nesting Depth

Apache Fory™ provides protection against stack overflow from deeply nested dynamic objects during deserialization. By default, the maximum nesting depth is set to 5 levels for trait objects and containers.

**Default configuration:**

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().build(); // max_dyn_depth = 5
```

**Custom depth limit:**

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().max_dyn_depth(10).build(); // Allow up to 10 levels
```

**When to adjust:**

- **Increase**: For legitimate deeply nested data structures
- **Decrease**: For stricter security requirements or shallow data structures

**Protected types:**

- `Box<dyn Any>`, `Rc<dyn Any>`, `Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>`
- `Box<dyn Trait>`, `Rc<dyn Trait>`, `Arc<dyn Trait>` (trait objects)
- `RcWeak<T>`, `ArcWeak<T>`
- Collection types (Vec, HashMap, HashSet)
- Nested struct types in Compatible mode

Note: Static data types (non-dynamic types) are secure by nature and not subject to depth limits, as their structure is known at compile time.

### Remote Schema Metadata Limits

Compatible mode can receive remote metadata for schema evolution. These limits
bound metadata size and accepted schema versions:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder()
    .max_type_fields(512)
    .max_type_meta_bytes(4096)
    .max_schema_versions_per_type(10)
    .max_average_schema_versions_per_type(3)
    .build();
```

- `max_type_fields` defaults to `512` and limits fields in one received struct metadata body.
- `max_type_meta_bytes` defaults to `4096` and limits encoded body bytes in one received TypeDef or
  TypeMeta body, excluding the 8-byte header and any extended-size varint.
- `max_schema_versions_per_type` defaults to `10` and limits accepted remote metadata versions for
  one logical type.
- `max_average_schema_versions_per_type` defaults to `3` and limits the average across accepted
  remote types. The effective global floor is `8192` schemas.

### Graph Memory Budget

`max_graph_memory_bytes(...)` sets an approximate graph-memory gate for one root read. The estimate
mainly covers materialized collections, maps, arrays, structs, and objects; it is not an exact
process heap limit. It skips leaf values such as strings, binary data, primitive scalars, and dense
primitive arrays, so actual process memory can be higher than this value. Leaf values remain
protected by byte-availability checks: if the unread input does not contain enough bytes, Fory will
not read or create that leaf value. The default is a fixed `128 MiB` for all root input forms. Set a
positive byte value when trusted payloads need a larger or smaller gate:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder()
    .max_graph_memory_bytes(256 * 1024 * 1024)
    .build();
```

Zero is rejected when the runtime is created.

### Explicit Xlang Examples

Set `.xlang(true)` explicitly for xlang serialization examples:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().xlang(true).build();
```

## Builder Pattern

```rust
use fory::Fory;

// Default xlang configuration
let fory = Fory::builder().build();

// Native mode for Rust-only traffic
let fory = Fory::builder().xlang(false).build();

// Same-schema optimization for Rust-only payloads
let fory = Fory::builder().xlang(false).compatible(false).build();

// Custom depth limit
let fory = Fory::builder().max_dyn_depth(10).build();

// Custom graph memory budget
let fory = Fory::builder()
    .max_graph_memory_bytes(256 * 1024 * 1024)
    .build();

// Combined configuration
let fory = Fory::builder()
    .xlang(false)
    .max_dyn_depth(10)
    .build();
```

| `max_average_schema_versions_per_type(usize)` | Average remote metadata versions across types     | `3`       |

## Compatible Mode

Compatible mode is enabled by default for both xlang and native mode. Keep this default when Rust
structs may evolve independently, when services deploy separately, or when xlang schemas are written
by hand in different languages.

Use `.compatible(false)` only when the schema used to deserialize every payload is always the same as the schema used to serialize it and you want faster serialization and smaller size. For xlang payloads, use `.compatible(false)` only after verifying that every language uses the same schema, or when native types are generated from Fory schema IDL.

## Security

Security-related configuration:

- Register application structs and trait-object implementations before deserializing untrusted
  payloads.
- Use `max_dyn_depth(...)` to reject unexpectedly deep dynamic object graphs.
- Keep `max_graph_memory_bytes(...)` at the fixed `128 MiB` default for most inputs, or set a
  positive byte gate for trusted workloads with different legitimate collection/map/struct sizes.
- Keep the remote schema metadata limits at their defaults unless the data is not malicious and a
  trusted peer sends larger metadata or many schema versions.
- Prefer concrete typed fields over `dyn Any` or broad trait-object fields for untrusted input.
