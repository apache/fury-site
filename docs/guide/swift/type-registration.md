This page covers registration APIs for user-defined types.

## Why Registration Is Required

Register user-defined structs, classes, enums, unions, and external targets
before serialization or deserialization.

If a type is missing, deserialization fails with:

- `Type not registered: ...`

## Register by Numeric ID

Use a stable ID shared by serializer and deserializer peers.

```swift
@ForyStruct
struct User {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int32 = 0
}

let fory = Fory()
try fory.register(User.self, id: 1)
```

For an external structural serializer, register the separate serializer
declaration:

```swift
@ForyStruct(target: ThirdParty.User.self)
struct UserSerializer {
    var name: String
    var age: UInt32
}

try fory.register(UserSerializer.self, id: 1)
```

If an application intentionally gives an external type one retroactive
`Serializer` conformance with `Target == Self`, register the target itself:

```swift
try fory.register(UUID.self, id: 2)
```

After registering a separate serializer, select it explicitly at each root,
field, or carrier child where it is required.

## Register by Name

### Fully-qualified name

```swift
try fory.register(User.self, name: "com.example.User")
```

`name` is split by the last `.`:

- namespace: `com.example`
- type name: `User`

Simple names such as `User` use an empty namespace. Empty names and names ending in `.` are invalid.

## Consistency Rules

Keep registration mapping consistent across peers:

- ID mode: same type uses same numeric ID on all peers
- Name mode: same type uses same namespace and type name on all peers
- Do not mix ID and name mapping for the same logical type across services
- Register only one serializer for each target type on a `Fory` instance

Registration closes after the first root serialization or deserialization.
Complete all registrations before the first root operation.

## Dynamic Types and Registration

When serializing `Any`, `AnyObject`, or application protocol values, register
each concrete target through its ordinary, external structural, or custom
serializer. `Any` and `AnyObject` use direct root APIs; application protocols
select `DynamicSerializer<T>` explicitly.
