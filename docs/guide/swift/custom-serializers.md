Use a custom serializer when a target needs a custom encoding or cannot meet
the direct-access requirements of an
[external structural serializer](external-types.md).

A custom serializer is not limited to external types:

- A target that itself conforms to `Serializer` with `Target == Self` selects
  that implementation implicitly everywhere.
- A separate serializer whose `Target` is another type must be selected
  explicitly everywhere it is needed.

The same selection rules apply to roots, generated fields, optionals, arrays,
sets, and dictionaries. Register a separate serializer and select it explicitly
where it is used.

## When to Use a Custom Serializer

- The target has private or immutable state.
- The target must enforce construction invariants.
- The target needs a specialized compact encoding.
- The target needs custom validation or construction logic.
- An external enum is not exhaustively switchable.
- An external union cannot represent `UnknownCase`.

## User-Owned Targets

When you own the target, implement `Serializer` on the target itself and set
`Target` to the same type:

```swift
import Fory

struct AccountID: Serializer, Equatable {
    typealias Target = AccountID

    let rawValue: UInt64

    static var staticTypeId: TypeId {
        .ext
    }

    static func writeData(
        _ value: AccountID,
        _ context: WriteContext
    ) throws {
        try UInt64.writeData(value.rawValue, context)
    }

    static func readData(
        _ context: ReadContext
    ) throws -> AccountID {
        AccountID(rawValue: try UInt64.readData(context))
    }
}
```

Register and use the type through the ordinary root APIs:

```swift
let fory = Fory()
try fory.register(AccountID.self, id: 300)

let input = AccountID(rawValue: 42)
let data = try fory.serialize(input)
let output: AccountID = try fory.deserialize(data)

assert(input == output)
```

No `with:` argument is needed because `AccountID.Target == AccountID`.

## One Global Serializer for an External Type

Swift permits an application to make an external type implement `Serializer`
through a retroactive conformance:

```swift
import Foundation
import Fory

extension UUID: @retroactive Serializer {
    public typealias Target = UUID

    public static var staticTypeId: TypeId {
        .ext
    }

    public static func defaultValue(
        _ context: ReadContext
    ) throws -> UUID {
        _ = context
        return UUID(
            uuidString: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        )!
    }

    public static func writeData(
        _ value: UUID,
        _ context: WriteContext
    ) throws {
        try String.writeData(value.uuidString, context)
    }

    public static func readData(
        _ context: ReadContext
    ) throws -> UUID {
        let raw = try String.readData(context)
        guard let uuid = UUID(uuidString: raw) else {
            throw ForyError.invalidData("invalid UUID string: \(raw)")
        }
        return uuid
    }
}
```

Register the external type itself:

```swift
try fory.register(UUID.self, id: 300)

let input = UUID()
let data = try fory.serialize(input)
let output: UUID = try fory.deserialize(data)
```

Because `UUID.Target == UUID`, unannotated generated fields and ordinary
carriers also select this implementation:

```swift
@ForyStruct
struct Request {
    var requestID: UUID
}

let input = [UUID(), UUID()]
let data = try fory.serialize(input)
let output: [UUID] = try fory.deserialize(data)
```

A retroactive conformance applies to the entire process. Swift allows only one
`Serializer` conformance for a given type; `@retroactive` acknowledges the
compiler warning but does not make competing conformances safe. Use this form
only when the application intentionally chooses the single global
implementation. Public libraries should generally provide a separate
serializer instead.

## Separate Serializers

Use a separate serializer when a public library must not claim a process-global
conformance or when an application needs multiple or alternative
implementations. The target may be external or user-owned:

```swift
import Foundation
import Fory

public enum UUIDStringSerializer: Serializer {
    public typealias Target = UUID

    public static var staticTypeId: TypeId {
        .ext
    }

    public static func defaultValue(
        _ context: ReadContext
    ) throws -> UUID {
        _ = context
        return UUID(
            uuidString: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        )!
    }

    public static func writeData(
        _ value: UUID,
        _ context: WriteContext
    ) throws {
        try String.writeData(value.uuidString, context)
    }

    public static func readData(
        _ context: ReadContext
    ) throws -> UUID {
        let raw = try String.readData(context)
        guard let uuid = UUID(uuidString: raw) else {
            throw ForyError.invalidData("invalid UUID string: \(raw)")
        }
        return uuid
    }
}
```

Register the separate serializer and select it explicitly at the root:

```swift
let fory = Fory()
try fory.register(UUIDStringSerializer.self, id: 300)

let input = UUID()
let data = try fory.serialize(input, with: UUIDStringSerializer.self)
let output = try fory.deserialize(data, with: UUIDStringSerializer.self)

assert(input == output)
```

Another declaration, such as `UUIDBytesSerializer`, may target the same type
with a different body. Fory cannot choose between separate serializers
automatically. Select the desired serializer with `with:` at roots and with the
matching field annotation. Register only one implementation for the target on
a given `Fory` instance.

The direct `Any` and `AnyObject` root conveniences remain dynamic operations.
A registered serializer may be used for a concrete value passed as `Any`, but
typed roots and fields still require `with:` for a separate serializer.

## Fields and Carriers

A field whose type directly implements `Serializer` with `Target == Self`
needs no selector:

```swift
@ForyStruct
struct Request {
    var accountID: AccountID
}
```

A separate serializer must be selected explicitly:

```swift
@ForyStruct
struct ExternalRequest {
    @ForyField(with: UUIDStringSerializer.self)
    var requestID: UUID
}
```

Ordinary carriers containing types that directly implement `Serializer` need
no selector. This includes intentional retroactive conformances:

```swift
let accountIDs = [
    AccountID(rawValue: 1),
    AccountID(rawValue: 2),
]
let data = try fory.serialize(accountIDs)
let output: [AccountID] = try fory.deserialize(data)
```

For an element that uses a separate serializer, name it in the carrier
annotation:

```swift
@ListField(element: .with(UUIDStringSerializer.self))
var requestIDs: [UUID]
```

At a root, use the matching carrier serializer:

```swift
let data = try fory.serialize(
    requestIDs,
    with: ArraySerializer<UUIDStringSerializer>.self
)
```

## Custom Serializer Rules

A custom serializer must return `.ext` from `staticTypeId`. The
`.structType`, `.enumType`, and `.typedUnion` values are reserved for
`@ForyStruct`, `@ForyEnum`, and `@ForyUnion`.

`writeData` and `readData` process only the target body. Do not call a root
`serialize` or `deserialize` method from either operation.

## Defaults

Implement `defaultValue(_:)` only when the target has a valid value for a null
or missing field.

## Input Validation

Reject invalid input with an appropriate `ForyError`.

## Custom Class Serializers

For a cyclic class, override the complete-value `read` operation and use Fory's
reference APIs so repeated references resolve to the same object.
