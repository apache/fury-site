Apache Fory™ C# can preserve shared and circular references when `TrackRef(true)` is enabled.

## Enable Reference Tracking

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .TrackRef(true)
    .Build();
```

When enabled:

- Shared object identity is preserved.
- Circular object graphs can be serialized/deserialized safely.

## Circular Reference Example

```csharp
using Apache.Fory;

[ForyStruct]
public sealed class Node
{
    public int Value { get; set; }
    public Node? Next { get; set; }
}

Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .TrackRef(true)
    .Build();
fory.Register<Node>(200);

Node node = new() { Value = 7 };
node.Next = node;

byte[] payload = fory.Serialize(node);
Node decoded = fory.Deserialize<Node>(payload);

// The cycle is preserved.
System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(object.ReferenceEquals(decoded, decoded.Next));
```

## When to Use `TrackRef(false)`

`TrackRef(false)` can be faster for tree-like, acyclic data where reference identity does not matter.

C# union wrappers are immutable and are created after their case payload is read.
Reference cycles from a union case payload back to the containing union are not
supported; Fory rejects unresolved refs instead of returning a partial union.
