Go native serialization is the Go-only wire mode selected with `fory.WithXlang(false)`. Use it
when every writer and reader is a Go service and the payload should follow Go's type system instead
of the portable xlang type system.

Use [Xlang Serialization](xlang-serialization.md), the default Go mode, when bytes must be read by
Java, Python, C++, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Swift, Dart, Scala, Kotlin,
or another non-Go Fory implementation.

## When To Use Native Serialization

Use native serialization when:

- A payload is produced and consumed only by Go applications.
- The data model uses Go-specific behavior such as native `int`/`uint`, nil slices, nil maps,
  pointers, interfaces, or Go-only dynamic values.
- You want faster serialization and smaller size, and every reader uses the same struct schema as
  the writer.
- You want compatible schema evolution for Go-only rolling deployments without committing to a
  cross-language type mapping.
- You are using Go fast serializers for structs that never leave Go.

## Create a Native-Mode Fory Instance

```go
package main

import "github.com/apache/fory/go/fory"

type Order struct {
    ID     int64
    Amount float64
}

func main() {
    f := fory.New(fory.WithXlang(false))
    if err := f.RegisterStruct(Order{}, 100); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    data, err := f.Serialize(&Order{ID: 1, Amount: 42.5})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    var decoded Order
    if err := f.Deserialize(data, &decoded); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

Reuse a configured `Fory` instance. The default instance owns reusable buffers and is not
thread-safe; use the thread-safe wrapper for concurrent goroutines.

```go
import (
    "github.com/apache/fory/go/fory"
    "github.com/apache/fory/go/fory/threadsafe"
)

f := threadsafe.New(fory.WithXlang(false), fory.WithTrackRef(true))
_ = f.RegisterStruct(Order{}, 100)
```

## Schema Evolution

Native serialization defaults to compatible mode. Keep that default when Go-only services roll
independently:

```go
writer := fory.New(fory.WithXlang(false))
reader := fory.New(fory.WithXlang(false))
```

Compatible mode writes schema metadata so readers can tolerate added, removed, or reordered fields
when field names or explicit field IDs remain compatible. See [Schema Evolution](schema-evolution.md).

For faster serialization and smaller size, set `WithCompatible(false)` only when
every reader and writer always uses the same Go struct schema.

## Registration

Register structs before serializing them. Prefer explicit numeric IDs for long-lived payloads:

```go
_ = f.RegisterStruct(Order{}, 100)
_ = f.RegisterStruct(LineItem{}, 101)
```

Name-based registration is useful when ID coordination is harder:

```go
_ = f.RegisterStructByName(Order{}, "example.Order")
```

If you register without stable IDs, every writer and reader must make the same registration choices.

## Go Object Surface

Native serialization keeps Go data in Go-native form:

- Primitive numeric types, including Go-native `int` and `uint`.
- Structs with exported fields.
- Slices, arrays, maps, and Fory sets.
- Pointers and nil values, including nil slices and maps.
- Interfaces and dynamic values when registered serializers can resolve their concrete types.
- Time values such as `time.Time` and `time.Duration`.
- Fast serializers.

Use [Supported Types](supported-types.md) for the full type surface and xlang mapping details.

## References And Pointers

Enable reference tracking for shared object identity or cycles:

```go
f := fory.New(fory.WithXlang(false), fory.WithTrackRef(true))

type Node struct {
    Value int32
    Next  *Node `fory:"ref"`
}
```

Disable reference tracking for value-shaped data. It is faster and smaller, but repeated pointers
deserialize as independent values and cyclic graphs are unsupported.

## Buffer Ownership

The default `Fory` instance reuses its internal buffer. Copy serialized bytes if they must outlive
the next serialization call:

```go
data, _ := f.Serialize(value)
stable := append([]byte(nil), data...)
```

The thread-safe wrapper copies bytes before returning them. For high-throughput single-threaded
code, serialize into a caller-owned `ByteBuffer`:

```go
buf := fory.NewByteBuffer(nil)
err := f.SerializeTo(buf, value)
data := buf.GetByteSlice(0, buf.WriterIndex())
_ = err
_ = data
```

## Performance Guidelines

- Reuse `Fory` or the thread-safe wrapper instead of constructing a Fory instance per request.
- Use `WithCompatible(false)` only when every reader and writer always uses the same Go struct
  schema and wants faster serialization and smaller size.
- Register structs with explicit numeric IDs.
- Disable reference tracking unless the graph requires identity or cycles.
- Copy returned bytes only when the data must survive the next serialization call.

## Native And Xlang Comparison

| Requirement                            | Use native serialization | Use xlang serialization |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Go-only payloads                       | Yes                      | Optional                |
| Non-Go readers or writers              | No                       | Yes                     |
| Go-native `int`, `uint`, nil slice/map | Yes                      | Limited                 |
| Same-schema compact payloads           | Yes                      | No                      |
| Compatible schema evolution by default | Yes                      | Yes                     |
| Portable type mapping across languages | No                       | Yes                     |

## Troubleshooting

### A non-Go implementation cannot read the payload

The writer is using native serialization. Rebuild it with `fory.WithXlang(true)` and align type
registration with every peer.

### A rolling deployment fails after a field change

Native serialization defaults to compatible mode. Keep that default when struct definitions can
differ.

### A nil slice or map changes shape

Use native serialization for Go-only payloads that must preserve Go nil slice/map semantics.
Cross-language schemas should model nullability explicitly.

### Returned bytes change after another serialization

The default `Fory` instance reuses its buffer. Copy the byte slice or use `threadsafe.New(...)`.
