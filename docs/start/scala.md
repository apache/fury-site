Fory Scala provides binary Object Serialization, generated models, and Fory
gRPC. The runtime artifact supports Scala 2.13 and Scala 3; generated Scala
models require Scala 3.

## Verify the Toolchain

```bash
java -version
scala -version
sbt --version
```

## Object Serialization

Add the runtime to `build.sbt`:

```sbt
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "3.3.1"
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.fory" %% "fory-scala" % "1.5.0"
```

Create `src/main/scala/ScalaExample.scala`:

```scala
import org.apache.fory.Fory
import org.apache.fory.scala.ForyScala

case class User(id: Long, name: String)

object ScalaExample {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val fory: Fory = ForyScala.builder()
      .withXlang(true)
      .build()
    fory.register(classOf[User], 1)

    val bytes = fory.serialize(User(1, "Alice"))
    val decoded = fory.deserialize(bytes).asInstanceOf[User]
    println(decoded.name)
  }
}
```

```bash
sbt run
```

Use xlang mode for data shared with other Fory runtimes or native mode for
Scala/JVM-only data. Continue with
[Scala Object Serialization](../object-serialization/scala/index.md),
[xlang](../object-serialization/scala/xlang.md), or
[native mode](../object-serialization/scala/native.md).

## Other Capabilities

- **Fory IDL and Compiler** generates Scala 3 models and registration helpers. See [Compiler Getting Started](../compiler/getting-started.md) and the [Scala generated-code guide](../compiler/generated-code/scala.md).
- **Fory gRPC** uses grpc-java transports with Fory-encoded messages. See [Scala gRPC](../grpc/scala.md).
