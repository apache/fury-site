Fory Go provides xlang and native Object Serialization, generated models, and
Fory gRPC. It is published as `github.com/apache/fory/go/fory` and requires Go
1.25 or later.

## Verify the Toolchain

```bash
go version
go env GOPROXY
```

## Object Serialization

Create a module and install the released Fory module:

```bash
mkdir fory-example
cd fory-example
go mod init example.com/fory-example
go get github.com/apache/fory/go/fory@v1.5.0
```

If a Go proxy has not picked up a new submodule tag yet, retry later or use
`GOPROXY=direct` temporarily.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/apache/fory/go/fory"
)

type User struct {
    ID   int64
    Name string
}

func main() {
    f := fory.New(fory.WithXlang(true))
    if err := f.RegisterStruct(User{}, 1); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    bytes, err := f.Serialize(&User{ID: 1, Name: "Alice"})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    var decoded User
    if err := f.Deserialize(bytes, &decoded); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(decoded.Name)
}
```

```bash
go run .
```

Use [xlang mode](../object-serialization/go/core-api.md#cross-language-interoperability) for cross-language data
and [native mode](../object-serialization/go/native.md) for Go-only data.
Continue with [Go Object Serialization](../object-serialization/go/index.md),
[configuration](../object-serialization/go/configuration.md), and
[schema evolution](../object-serialization/go/schema-evolution.md).

## Other Capabilities

- **Fory IDL and Compiler** generates Go models and registration helpers. See [Compiler Getting Started](../compiler/getting-started.md) and the [Go generated-code guide](../compiler/generated-code/go.md).
- **Fory gRPC** uses grpc-go transports with Fory-encoded messages. See [Go gRPC](../grpc/go.md).
