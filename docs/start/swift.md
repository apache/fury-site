Fory Swift provides xlang Object Serialization and compiler-generated models.
It is distributed through Swift Package Manager, uses Swift tools 6.0, and
targets macOS 13 or later and iOS 16 or later.

## Verify the Toolchain

```bash
swift --version
```

## Object Serialization

Create an executable package:

```bash
swift package init --type executable --name ForyExample
```

Add the released package and depend on its `Fory` library in the generated `Package.swift`:

```swift title="Package.swift"
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apache/fory.git", exact: "1.5.0")
],
targets: [
    .executableTarget(
        name: "ForyExample",
        dependencies: [.product(name: "Fory", package: "fory")]
    )
]
```

Replace `Sources/main.swift` with:

```swift title="Sources/main.swift"
import Fory

@ForyStruct
struct User: Equatable {
    var id: Int64 = 0
    var name: String = ""
}

let fory = Fory()
try fory.register(User.self, id: 1)

let input = User(id: 1, name: "Alice")
let bytes = try fory.serialize(input)
let decoded: User = try fory.deserialize(bytes)
assert(input == decoded)
```

```bash
swift run
```

Swift uses xlang mode. Continue with
[Swift Object Serialization](../object-serialization/swift/index.md),
[xlang types](../object-serialization/swift/basic-serialization.md#cross-language-interoperability),
[configuration](../object-serialization/swift/configuration.md), and
[schema evolution](../object-serialization/swift/schema-evolution.md).

## Other Capabilities

- **Fory IDL and Compiler** generates Swift models and registration helpers. See [Compiler Getting Started](../compiler/getting-started.md) and the [Swift generated-code guide](../compiler/generated-code/swift.md).
