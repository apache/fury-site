Start with a runtime page below. Each page includes a release-pinned installation,
a runnable object-serialization round trip, the modes supported by that runtime,
and a short path into every additional Fory capability available there.

Apache Fory™ releases are available as source artifacts and language-specific
packages. For source downloads, see the Apache Fory™
[download](https://fory.apache.org/download) page.

## First Five Minutes

1. Choose the runtime used by your application.
2. Install the package shown on that runtime page.
3. Run its minimal serialize/deserialize example.
4. Select xlang mode for cross-language data or native mode for same-runtime data
   when both are available.
5. Continue to the capability guide for production configuration and advanced APIs.

## Choose a Runtime

Each runtime page provides a release-pinned installation snippet, a minimal
round trip for an application project, and the next capability-specific steps:

| Runtime               | Setup                                  |

| Swift                 | [Swift](swift.md)                      |
| Dart                  | [Dart](dart.md)                        |
| Scala                 | [Scala](scala.md)                      |

Object Serialization uses xlang mode for portable cross-language data. Java,
Python, C++, Go, Rust, Scala, and Kotlin also offer native mode for
same-runtime data. Use [Choose a Format](../introduction/choose-a-format.md)
when you have not yet chosen a format.
