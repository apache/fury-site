Fory Kotlin provides binary Object Serialization, generated models, Fory gRPC,
and Android support. It runs on Fory Java and supports Java 8 and later.

## Verify the Toolchain

```bash
java -version
./gradlew --version
# or: mvn -version
```

## Object Serialization

Add the runtime to the application module:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
dependencies {
  implementation("org.apache.fory:fory-kotlin:1.5.0")
}
```

Create `src/main/kotlin/KotlinExample.kt`:

```kotlin
import org.apache.fory.ThreadSafeFory
import org.apache.fory.kotlin.ForyKotlin

data class User(val id: Long, val name: String)

fun main() {
    val fory: ThreadSafeFory = ForyKotlin.builder()
        .withXlang(true)
        .requireClassRegistration(true)
        .buildThreadSafeFory()
    fory.register(User::class.java, 1)

    val bytes = fory.serialize(User(1, "Alice"))
    val decoded = fory.deserialize(bytes) as User
    println(decoded.name)
}
```

If the project applies Gradle's `application` plugin, run its application task:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

Use xlang mode for data shared with other Fory runtimes or native mode for
Kotlin/JVM-only data. Continue with
[Kotlin Object Serialization](../object-serialization/kotlin/index.md),
[xlang](../object-serialization/kotlin/basic-serialization.md#cross-language-interoperability), or
[native mode](../object-serialization/kotlin/native.md).

## Other Capabilities

- **Fory IDL and Compiler** generates Kotlin models and registration helpers through KSP. See [Compiler Getting Started](../compiler/getting-started.md) and the [Kotlin generated-code guide](../compiler/generated-code/kotlin.md).
- **Fory gRPC** uses grpc-kotlin and grpc-java transports with Fory-encoded messages. See [Kotlin gRPC](../grpc/kotlin.md).
- **Android** uses generated serializers with the same Fory Kotlin runtime. See [Android Object Serialization](../object-serialization/java/android.md).
