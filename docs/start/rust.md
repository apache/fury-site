Fory Rust provides xlang and native Object Serialization, standard Row Format,
generated models, and Fory gRPC. The public `fory` crate is published on
crates.io, supports Rust 1.70 or later, and uses the Rust 2021 edition.

## Verify the Toolchain

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Object Serialization

Add the public crate:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
fory = "1.5.0"
```

```rust
use fory::{Error, Fory, ForyStruct};

#[derive(ForyStruct, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct User {
    id: i64,
    name: String,
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let mut fory = Fory::builder().xlang(true).build();
    fory.register::<User>(1)?;

    let user = User {
        id: 1,
        name: "Alice".to_string(),
    };
    let bytes = fory.serialize(&user)?;
    let decoded: User = fory.deserialize(&bytes)?;
    assert_eq!(user, decoded);
    Ok(())
}
```

Use [xlang mode](../object-serialization/rust/core-api.md#cross-language-interoperability) for cross-language data
and [native mode](../object-serialization/rust/native.md) for Rust-only data.
Continue with [Rust Object Serialization](../object-serialization/rust/index.md),
[configuration](../object-serialization/rust/configuration.md), and
[type registration](../object-serialization/rust/type-registration.md).

## Other Capabilities

- **Row Format** provides zero-copy views over trusted analytical data using the standard Fory Row layout. See [Rust Row Format](../row-format/rust.md).
- **Fory IDL and Compiler** generates Rust models and registration helpers. See [Compiler Getting Started](../compiler/getting-started.md) and the [Rust generated-code guide](../compiler/generated-code/rust.md).
- **Fory gRPC** uses tonic transports with Fory-encoded messages. See [Rust gRPC](../grpc/rust.md).
