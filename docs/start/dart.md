Fory Dart provides xlang Object Serialization, generated models, and Fory gRPC.
It is published on pub.dev, requires Dart 3.7 or later, and uses `build_runner`
to generate serializers.

## Verify the Toolchain

```bash
dart --version
dart pub --help
```

## Object Serialization

Add Fory and the generator to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fory: 1.5.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
```

Create `lib/person.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:fory/fory.dart';

part 'person.fory.dart';

@ForyStruct()
class Person {
  Person();

  @ForyField(type: Int64Type())
  int id = 0;
  String name = '';
}

void main() {
  final fory = Fory();
  PersonForyModule.register(fory, Person, name: 'example.Person');

  final input = Person()
    ..id = 1
    ..name = 'Alice';
  final bytes = fory.serialize(input);
  final decoded = fory.deserialize<Person>(bytes);
  print(decoded.name);
}
```

Generate the serializer and run the example:

```bash
dart pub get
dart run build_runner build
dart run lib/person.dart
```

Dart uses xlang mode. Continue with
[Dart Object Serialization](../object-serialization/dart/index.md),
[code generation](../object-serialization/dart/code-generation.md),
[web support](../object-serialization/dart/web-platform-support.md), and
[schema evolution](../object-serialization/dart/schema-evolution.md).

## Other Capabilities

- **Fory IDL and Compiler** generates Dart models and registration helpers. See [Compiler Getting Started](../compiler/getting-started.md) and the [Dart generated-code guide](../compiler/generated-code/dart.md).
- **Fory gRPC** uses package:grpc transports with Fory-encoded messages. See [Dart gRPC](../grpc/dart.md).
