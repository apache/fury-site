Contributor documentation covers repository setup, builds, tests, debugging, and release-oriented
workflows. It is separate from the user guides for released artifacts.

### Java

```bash
cd java
mvn -T16 package
```

Requirements:

- JDK 17+
- Maven 3.6.3+

### Python

```bash
cd python
pip install -v -e .

# Optional: build Cython extension (replace X.Y with your Python version)
bazel build //:cp_fory_so --@rules_python//python/config_settings:python_version=X.Y
```

Requirements:
