External-type serialization generates a serializer for a class, struct, or
enum that cannot carry its own Fory annotation. The target can come from a
referenced package or from generated or otherwise unmodifiable source. A local
declaration supplies the schema while Fory reads and writes the target value
directly.

## Class and Struct Targets

Suppose another package defines this class:

```csharp
namespace ThirdParty;

public sealed class User
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

Declare its external structural serializer in your project:

```csharp
using Apache.Fory;
using S = Apache.Fory.Schema.Types;

[ForyStruct(Target = typeof(ThirdParty.User))]
internal abstract class UserSerializer
{
    [ForyField(
        1,
        TargetDeclaringType = typeof(ThirdParty.User),
        TargetMemberName = "<Name>k__BackingField")]
    public abstract string Name { get; }

    [ForyField(
        2,
        Type = typeof(S.Int32),
        TargetDeclaringType = typeof(ThirdParty.User),
        TargetMemberName = "<Age>k__BackingField")]
    public abstract int Age { get; }
}
```

`Name` and `Age` are the logical wire names. Each declaration maps directly to
the target's backing field, so the same declaration also accounts for its
shallow object storage. A public target field can use the default same-name
mapping.

The declaration is generator input only. Do not instantiate or register
`UserSerializer`.

The same form supports an external struct:

```csharp
[ForyStruct(Target = typeof(ThirdParty.Point))]
internal abstract class PointSerializer
{
    [ForyField(1)]
    public abstract int X { get; }

    [ForyField(2)]
    public abstract int Y { get; }
}
```

## Exact Member Mappings

By default, a declaration property binds a visible target field or property
with the same case-sensitive name. For an external class target, set
`TargetDeclaringType` and `TargetMemberName` together to bind an exact field
declared by the target or one of its non-`object` base classes:

```csharp
[ForyStruct(Target = typeof(ThirdParty.Account))]
internal abstract class AccountSerializer
{
    [ForyField(
        1,
        TargetDeclaringType = typeof(ThirdParty.Account),
        TargetMemberName = "_identifier")]
    public abstract long Id { get; }

    [ForyField(
        2,
        TargetDeclaringType = typeof(ThirdParty.Account),
        TargetMemberName = "<Secret>k__BackingField")]
    public abstract string Credential { get; }

    [ForyField(
        Ignore = true,
        TargetDeclaringType = typeof(ThirdParty.Account),
        TargetMemberName = "_cache")]
    public abstract int CacheStorage { get; }
}
```

The declaration property name remains the logical schema name:

- An exact field mapping is both a wire member and a physical storage field.
- `Ignore = true` contributes an exact field to shallow storage without adding
  it to the wire schema.
- Every non-public instance field must be listed exactly once so the shallow
  graph-memory estimate covers the target's complete instance storage. Static
  fields are not instance storage.

Fory does not inspect private members in the referenced package. An exact
private mapping is an application-owned package ABI declaration. Pin and test
the package version together with the declaration. If a mapped private field
changes, the generated exact accessor fails with the CLR's missing-field error;
Fory does not fall back to reflection or another member. An ignored private
field has no runtime accessor, so validate that storage declaration against the
pinned package build.

External struct targets support visible field and property mappings only.
Exact mappings and `Ignore` are class-only because value storage belongs to the
holder that materializes the struct. An inaccessible pointer field is also
rejected: without reading private package layout, the generator cannot
distinguish pointer storage from a fixed buffer. Use a custom serializer for
these shapes.

## Third-Party Base Classes

An ordinary `[ForyStruct]` class can inherit an unmodifiable third-party class.
Declare one external hierarchy provider for its immediate third-party base and
set `BaseOnly = true`.

For example, assume a package defines:

```csharp
namespace ThirdParty;

public class VendorBase
{
    private long _identifier;
    private string Secret { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    private readonly int _cache;
}

public class VendorRecord : VendorBase
{
    public int Revision;
}
```

A shared schema assembly can declare the complete third-party prefix:

```csharp
using Apache.Fory;

[ForyStruct(Target = typeof(ThirdParty.VendorRecord), BaseOnly = true)]
public abstract class VendorRecordHierarchy
{
    [ForyField(
        1,
        TargetDeclaringType = typeof(ThirdParty.VendorBase),
        TargetMemberName = "_identifier")]
    public abstract long Identifier { get; }

    [ForyField(
        2,
        TargetDeclaringType = typeof(ThirdParty.VendorBase),
        TargetMemberName = "<Secret>k__BackingField")]
    public abstract string Secret { get; }

    [ForyField(
        Ignore = true,
        TargetDeclaringType = typeof(ThirdParty.VendorBase),
        TargetMemberName = "_cache")]
    public abstract int CacheStorage { get; }

    [ForyField(3)]
    public abstract int Revision { get; }
}
```

The application class then carries its own direct annotation:

```csharp
[ForyStruct]
public sealed class LocalRecord : ThirdParty.VendorRecord
{
    [ForyField(4)]
    public string Label { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
```

Register `LocalRecord`. Do not register `ThirdParty.VendorRecord`; a `BaseOnly`
declaration exists only to support annotated derived classes.

The provider declaration may list exact fields from every third-party ancestor
of its target. Fory does not discover private package fields. Put a public
`BaseOnly` declaration in a shared referenced assembly when consumer assemblies
derive from the same third-party base.

A `BaseOnly` target may be abstract or lack a parameterless constructor as
long as each concrete annotated child has a legal parameterless construction
path.

First-party bases use direct `[ForyStruct]` annotations instead. See
[Class Inheritance](basic-serialization.md#class-inheritance).

## Declaration and Target Requirements

An external structural declaration must be a non-generic abstract class
containing only abstract get-only declaration properties. Each wire property:

- binds a visible member by the same name or an explicitly named exact field;
- has the target member's CLR type and generic shape;
- has matching explicit nullability when the target metadata provides it; and
- may use the standard `ForyField` ID and schema descriptor options.

When target metadata is nullable-oblivious, the declaration selects schema
nullability. Members not declared as wire fields keep their constructor or
derived behavior after deserialization.

A standalone external target must be an accessible concrete class or struct
with a legal parameterless construction path and writable declared wire state.
Constructor-bound, factory-only, readonly, init-only, converted, or
custom-wire targets require a [custom serializer](custom-serializers.md).

Closed generic targets such as `ThirdParty.Box<string>` are supported. On
.NET 8, a private wire member whose declaring type or signature is generic
requires a custom serializer. Visible generic members and exact ignored class
field mappings remain supported. Open generic targets are not supported.

## Enum Targets

Use an empty static serializer declaration for an enum:

```csharp
[ForyEnum(Target = typeof(ThirdParty.Status))]
internal static class StatusSerializer
{
}
```

The target enum's numeric values are authoritative. Do not copy its constants
into the declaration. Every serialized numeric value must fit in the unsigned
32-bit Fory enum tag range. Cross-language peers must use matching explicit
enum tags, such as Java's `@ForyEnumId`.

## Registration and Root Values

Register the target through the normal APIs:

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder().Build();
fory.Register<ThirdParty.User>(100);
fory.Register<ThirdParty.Status>("example.Status");

ThirdParty.User user = new() { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };
byte[] bytes = fory.Serialize(user);
ThirdParty.User decoded = fory.Deserialize<ThirdParty.User>(bytes);
```

The split namespace/name overloads and `ThreadSafeFory` registration work the
same way. There is no separate external-type registration or root API.

## Fields and Carriers

Use the target type directly in generated models:

```csharp
[ForyStruct]
public sealed class Group
{
    public ThirdParty.User Owner { get; set; } = new();

    public List<ThirdParty.User> Users { get; set; } = [];

    public Dictionary<string, ThirdParty.User> UsersByName { get; set; } = [];
}
```

Root carrier composition also uses the ordinary typed API:

```csharp
ThirdParty.User user = new() { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };
byte[] bytes = fory.Serialize(new List<ThirdParty.User> { user });

List<ThirdParty.User> decoded =
    fory.Deserialize<List<ThirdParty.User>>(bytes);
```

External children are supported through the concrete carrier types already
supported by the C# runtime:

- `Nullable<T>` for external structs and one-dimensional `T[]`;
- `List<T>`, `LinkedList<T>`, `Queue<T>`, and `Stack<T>`;
- `HashSet<T>`, `SortedSet<T>`, and `ImmutableHashSet<T>`;
- `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`,
  `SortedList<TKey, TValue>`, `ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, and
  `NullableKeyDictionary<TKey, TValue>`.

Targets can appear as map keys or values and inside recursively nested
carriers. Collection interface types are not supported as generated fields or
typed roots.

## Schema Evolution

Set `Evolving` on a standalone external serializer declaration:

```csharp
[ForyStruct(
    Target = typeof(ThirdParty.User),
    Evolving = false)]
internal abstract class UserSerializer
{
    [ForyField(
        TargetDeclaringType = typeof(ThirdParty.User),
        TargetMemberName = "<Name>k__BackingField")]
    public abstract string Name { get; }
}
```

Field IDs, field names, schema descriptors, and `Evolving` come from the
declaration. Compatible and schema-consistent modes otherwise behave exactly
as they do for an ordinary generated C# type.

A `BaseOnly` declaration cannot set `Evolving`; it does not create a root
serializer. Each concrete annotated descendant owns its own `Evolving`
setting.

## Dynamic Values and References

After registering the target, it can appear in `object`-based dynamic roots,
fields, collections, and maps. Register every concrete target that can appear
dynamically.

Mutable external classes retain shared-reference and cycle support when
reference tracking is enabled. External structs remain inline values.

This feature does not add arbitrary interface or base-class polymorphism.
