Use this page when a Swift reader accepts bytes from outside the application's trust boundary.
Fory reconstructs application values; it does not authenticate the sender, protect transport
integrity, or decide whether a valid value is authorized for a business operation.

## Application boundary

Before deserialization:

- Authenticate the sender and protect message integrity at the transport or storage layer.
- Enforce request or file size, timeout, and concurrency limits outside Fory.
- Register only the application types the endpoint accepts and configure the reader before its
  first root operation.
- Validate the deserialized value against application authorization and domain rules before use.

## Runtime safeguards

Security-related configuration:

- Register only the expected generated models before deserializing untrusted payloads.
- Use `checkClassVersion` with `compatible: false` for intentional same-schema payloads.
- Set `maxDepth` for the largest dynamic `Any` nesting depth your service accepts.
- Set `maxGraphMemoryBytes` as an approximate gate for collection, map, array, struct, class, and
  object-heavy payloads. It is not an exact heap cap; leaf values are gated by remaining input
  bytes.
- Keep the remote schema metadata limits at their defaults unless the data is not malicious and a
  trusted peer sends larger metadata or many schema versions.

## Verification

Add negative tests for the boundary as well as normal round trips. Verify that the configured reader
rejects unexpected application types, excessive nesting, resource-limit violations, and malformed
input. After a failed read, verify that a valid root can still be read with the reusable runtime.

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for the complete option reference and
[Type Registration](type-registration.md) for the runtime's registration API.
