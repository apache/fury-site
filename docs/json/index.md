Fory JSON is Apache Fory's thread-safe Java JSON codec. It provides interpreted and
runtime-generated codecs for Java objects, records, immutable creator-based classes, common JDK
types, generic containers, custom complete-value codecs, and finite annotation-declared
polymorphism.

Fory JSON is a separate data format from Fory's binary native and xlang protocols. Use it when a
system must exchange ordinary JSON with browsers, APIs, logs, configuration, or another JSON
implementation. Use the Fory binary protocol when you need cross-language schema metadata,
reference identity, circular graphs, or Fory's binary-only features.

## Limits and unsupported features

Fory JSON intentionally has a smaller semantic surface than the Fory binary protocol and general
Jackson object mapping:

- no shared-reference identity or circular-reference protocol;
- no open polymorphism, JSON class-name IDs, runtime subtype discovery, or runtime subtype table
  extension;
- no `InputStream` parser or incremental `OutputStream` writer on the `ForyJson` root API;
- no pretty-print configuration;
- no Jackson/Gson annotation compatibility layer;
- no aliases, views, filters, injection, managed/back references, object identity annotations, or
  root wrapping;
- no Fory core `Expose` processing.

Circular graphs eventually fail `maxDepth`; they are not reconstructed. Use Fory core's binary
native or xlang protocol when reference identity or cycles are required.

## Related Java guides

For binary serialization, start with [Java Object Serialization](../object-serialization/java/index.md)
and choose [xlang](../object-serialization/java/basic-serialization.md#cross-language-interoperability) or
[native](../object-serialization/java/native.md). Binary builder options are documented separately
in [Java Configuration](../object-serialization/java/configuration.md).
