Fory JSON is Apache Fory's thread-safe JSON codec for Java and Scala. It provides interpreted and
runtime-generated codecs for Java objects, records, immutable creator-based classes, common JDK
types, generic containers, Scala models and collections, and custom complete-value codecs.

Fory JSON is a separate data format from Fory's binary native and xlang protocols. Use it when a
system must exchange ordinary JSON with browsers, APIs, logs, configuration, or another JSON
implementation. Use the Fory binary protocol when you need cross-language schema metadata,
reference identity, circular graphs, or Fory's binary-only features.

## Performance

The Java JSON benchmark compares fory-json, Jackson, and Gson with the same data. Results below are
single-threaded throughput measurements on an Apple M4 Pro with JDK 26.0.1; higher is better. See
the [complete benchmark report](../benchmarks/json/java/README.md) for the command, environment, and
measurement configuration.

## Related Java guides

For binary serialization, start with [Java Object Serialization](../object-serialization/java/index.md)
and choose [xlang](../object-serialization/java/basic-serialization.md#cross-language-interoperability) or
[native](../object-serialization/java/native.md). Binary builder options are documented separately
in [Java Configuration](../object-serialization/java/configuration.md).
