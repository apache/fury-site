`ForyJsonModule` packages a coherent set of Fory JSON registrations into one reusable extension.
A module can be provided by a language integration, a third-party library, a framework, or an
application. Use a module when consumers should install the whole extension with one builder call;
use direct builder registration for an application-specific codec that does not need separate
distribution.

## Creating and Installing a Module

After implementing a codec such as `MoneyCodec` from the
[Custom Codecs guide](custom-codecs.md), a library can distribute its registration as a module:

```java
import org.apache.fory.json.ForyJson;
import org.apache.fory.json.ForyJsonModule;
import org.apache.fory.json.ModuleContext;

public final class MoneyJsonModule implements ForyJsonModule {
  public static final MoneyJsonModule INSTANCE = new MoneyJsonModule();

  private MoneyJsonModule() {}

  @Override
  public void install(ModuleContext context) {
    context.registerCodec(Money.class, new MoneyCodec());
  }
}

ForyJson json =
    ForyJson.builder()
        .withModule(MoneyJsonModule.INSTANCE)
        .build();
```

Installation runs while `build()` creates the immutable runtime configuration. Treat a module
configuration as immutable after adding it to a builder. Registered codec instances are shared by
concurrent operations and must be thread-safe.

## Module Registrations

`ModuleContext` exposes the registrations needed by reusable integrations:

| Registration                             | Use                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `registerCodec(Class, JsonValueCodec)`   | One shared complete codec for an exact class             |
| `registerCodec(Class, JsonCodecFactory)` | A resolver-owned complete codec for an exact class       |
| `registerMixin(Class)`                   | An annotated Mixin for its declared target               |
| `registerCodecFactory(JsonCodecFactory)` | A codec family selected from a parameterized target type |

Codec implementations and `JsonCodecFactory` behavior are documented in
[Custom Codecs](custom-codecs.md). Modules only package those registrations for installation.

Application registrations made directly on `ForyJsonBuilder` take precedence over module exact
registrations. Conflicting module registrations fail during `build()` instead of depending on
installation order.

## Module Identity

`moduleKey()` identifies the module configuration for generated-code reuse and conflict checking.
The default key is the module class name and is sufficient for a configuration-free module.

A configurable module must return a deterministic key that includes every option affecting codec
selection or generated code. Do not include secrets, mutable process state, or values unrelated to
the installed JSON behavior.

```java
public final class ConfiguredJsonModule implements ForyJsonModule {
  private final boolean compactNames;

  public ConfiguredJsonModule(boolean compactNames) {
    this.compactNames = compactNames;
  }

  @Override
  public String moduleKey() {
    return getClass().getName() + ":compactNames=" + compactNames;
  }

  @Override
  public void install(ModuleContext context) {
    // Register the codecs, factories, or Mixins selected by this configuration.
  }
}
```

For a Scala example that packages derived third-party enum codecs in a module, see
[Packaging Derived Codecs in a Module](scala.md#packaging-derived-codecs-in-a-module).
