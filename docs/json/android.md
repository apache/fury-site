Fory JSON supports ordinary classes on Android API level 26 and later through the regular
`fory-json` artifact. Runtime JSON code generation and asynchronous compilation are disabled
automatically, so `ForyJson.builder().build()` uses the interpreted object mapper.

## Installation and Codec Model

Add Fory JSON to the application:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("org.apache.fory:fory-json:${foryVersion}")
}
```

## Custom Codecs

`@JsonCodec` has the same declaration behavior on Android and the JVM. It supports complete values,
direct collection and array elements, `Optional` and `AtomicReference` contents, Map keys and
values, ordinary getters, setter value parameters, and `JsonCreator` parameters:

```java
import java.util.List;
import org.apache.fory.json.annotation.JsonCodec;

public final class Invoice {
  @JsonCodec(elementCodec = MoneyCodec.class)
  public List<Money> items;
  private Money primary;

  public void setPrimary(@JsonCodec(MoneyCodec.class) Money primary) {
    this.primary = primary;
  }

  public Invoice() {}
}
```

Child codecs act on one direct level only. For example, `elementCodec` on `Money[][]` handles each
`Money[]`, and `elementCodec` on `AtomicReferenceArray<Money>` handles each `Money`. Use a complete
`value` codec when deeper custom behavior is required.

## Generated Access and R8 Rules

Add the annotation processor and mark application object models with `JsonType` to generate direct
field, getter, setter, Record constructor, `JsonCreator`, and `JsonValidator` operations together
with exact R8 rules:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  annotationProcessor("org.apache.fory:fory-annotation-processor:${foryVersion}")
}
```

```java
import org.apache.fory.json.annotation.JsonType;
import org.apache.fory.json.annotation.JsonValidator;

@JsonType
public final class Invoice {
  public long total;

  @JsonValidator
  public void validate() {
    if (total < 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("total must not be negative");
    }
  }
}
```

## Mixins

The same processor supports Fory JSON Mixins. A Mixin declares one exact target and is registered
on the `ForyJson` builder that should use it:

```java
import org.apache.fory.json.ForyJson;
import org.apache.fory.json.annotation.JsonBase64;
import org.apache.fory.json.annotation.JsonMixin;

@JsonMixin(target = ThirdPartyInvoice.class)
public abstract class ThirdPartyInvoiceMixin {
  @JsonBase64 byte[] signature;
}

ForyJson json =
    ForyJson.builder().registerMixin(ThirdPartyInvoiceMixin.class).build();
```

Compile every non-empty Mixin source with `fory-annotation-processor`. The processor emits exact
R8 rules and any pair-specific target operations that the built `ForyJson` instance can use. Registered codecs,
effective type codecs, and built-in mappings keep their normal codec-selection precedence. An empty Mixin
produces no generated output.

A Mixin may place `JsonValidator` on a public abstract zero-argument `void` method that exactly
matches a public target method. The generated pair calls that target method directly. The target
does not need `JsonType` solely for a Mixin validator.

The target does not need `JsonType` merely because it has a Mixin. `JsonMixin` is itself the
processor entry point for the pair. If a target also uses `JsonType`, the built `ForyJson` instance selects the
pair-specific companion for a non-empty registered Mixin instead of combining the overlay with the
target's direct companion.

Only one source is enabled for an exact target in one built `ForyJson` instance. A later registration for that
target replaces an earlier registration on the builder, and `build()` snapshots the selected
mapping. The processor may generate artifacts for multiple source alternatives; the built instance uses
only the last registered source.

Use the processor-generated R8 rules for non-empty Mixins instead of broad package keep rules.

## Reflection-Based Models

Ordinary non-Record classes that omit `JsonType` can supply equivalent exact rules themselves unless
they declare `JsonValidator`. Direct validators require the processor-generated calls from
`JsonType`; do not replace them with reflection rules. Retain every model constructor, field,
method, generic signature, declaration annotation, and parameter annotation used by Fory JSON,
plus the public no-argument constructor of every annotation-selected codec. For a model without a
validator:

```proguard
-keepattributes Signature,RuntimeVisibleAnnotations,RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations
-keepattributes AnnotationDefault,MethodParameters,InnerClasses,EnclosingMethod
-keep,allowoptimization class com.example.Invoice {
  public <init>();
  public java.util.List items;
  public void setPrimary(com.example.Money);
}
-keep,allowoptimization,allowobfuscation class com.example.MoneyCodec {
  public <init>();
}
```

The same exact-rule approach supports every `JsonCodec` member; it is not limited to complete-value
codecs. `JsonType` is not required for codec selection on an ordinary class.

For `@JsonType` models, generated operations and R8 rules also cover effective `JsonValidator`
methods, `JsonValue` fields and effective methods, fixed `JsonRawValue` and `JsonBase64` fields and
getters, `JsonFormat` date/time fields, their runtime annotations, and the Base64 codec constructor.
Without `@JsonType`, the value, raw, Base64, format, and codec annotations still work through
reflection, but a release-minified application must keep the exact annotated members, annotation
attributes, and codec constructor itself. A `JsonValue` method may use a non-JavaBean name, so its
manual rule must name that method explicitly. `JsonFormat` keeps the same direct-field and
one-wrapper-level behavior as on the JVM, including `timezone` for `Instant`, `ZonedDateTime`, and
`OffsetDateTime`.

Android Fory JSON requires a retained no-argument constructor for an ordinary mutable class; it may
be non-public when Android reflection can make it accessible. `JsonCreator` constructor-backed
classes follow the normal creator rules instead. Retain every field and method used for reflection,
or use an application codec when a model cannot satisfy those requirements. `JsonUnwrapped`
supports mutable classes, creator-backed classes, and Records through their normal property and
construction paths. When the containing model and its unwrapped children use `JsonType`, their
generated companions supply those operations.

## Records

Android-desugared Records require processor-generated operations from either a direct `@JsonType`
declaration or a compiled exact `@JsonMixin` pair. Manual R8 rules alone cannot reconstruct Record
component order because Android does not provide the Java Record reflection APIs. This also applies
to a Record whose complete representation is a `JsonValue` String: the generated companion
identifies the propagated component accessor and calls an annotated one-String canonical
constructor directly. Generated child codecs act on one level exactly as they do on the JVM. Every
Record in a `JsonUnwrapped` path needs its own direct `JsonType` declaration or compiled exact
`JsonMixin` pair. Use a complete value codec for deeper nested behavior.
