**Apache Fory™** is a high-performance multi-language serialization framework. The Rust implementation uses compile-time code generation for object serialization.

The Rust implementation provides versatile and high-performance serialization with automatic memory management and compile-time type safety. It supports both xlang mode for cross-language payloads and native mode for Rust-only payloads.

## Why Apache Fory™ Rust?

- **Fast binary encoding**: Zero-copy deserialization and optimized binary protocols
- **Xlang**: Seamlessly serialize/deserialize data across Java, Python, C++,
  Go, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Swift, Dart, Scala, and Kotlin
- **Type-safe**: Compile-time type checking with derive macros
- **Circular references**: Automatic tracking of shared and circular references with `Rc`/`Arc` and weak pointers
- **Polymorphic**: Serialize trait objects with `Box<dyn Trait>`, `Rc<dyn Trait>`, and `Arc<dyn Trait>`
- **Schema evolution**: Compatible mode for independent schema changes

## Crates

| Crate                                                                       | Description                                           | Version                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [`fory`](https://github.com/apache/fory/blob/main/rust/fory)                | User-facing API, public Fory types, and derive macros | [1.6.1](https://crates.io/crates/fory)        |
| [`fory-core`](https://github.com/apache/fory/blob/main/rust/fory-core/)     | Lower-level core crate for advanced integrations      | [1.6.1](https://crates.io/crates/fory-core)   |
| [`fory-derive`](https://github.com/apache/fory/blob/main/rust/fory-derive/) | Procedural macro crate for direct derive-macro use    | [1.6.1](https://crates.io/crates/fory-derive) |

Most applications should depend on `fory` only. It re-exports the derive
macros and the public Fory types needed by generated code. Use `fory-core`
or `fory-derive` directly only when intentionally building on the lower-level
crates.

## Quick Start

Add Apache Fory™ to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
fory = "1.6.1"
```

### Basic Example

```rust
use fory::{Fory, Error, Reader};
use fory::ForyStruct;

#[derive(ForyStruct, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct User {
    name: String,
    age: i32,
    email: String,
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let mut fory = Fory::builder().xlang(true).build();
    fory.register::<User>(1)?;

    let user = User {
        name: "Alice".to_string(),
        age: 30,
        email: "alice@example.com".to_string(),
    };

    // Serialize
    let bytes = fory.serialize(&user)?;
    // Deserialize
    let decoded: User = fory.deserialize(&bytes)?;
    assert_eq!(user, decoded);

    // Serialize to specified buffer
    let mut buf: Vec<u8> = vec![];
    fory.serialize_to(&mut buf, &user)?;
    // Deserialize from specified buffer
    let mut reader = Reader::new(&buf);
    let decoded: User = fory.deserialize_from(&mut reader)?;
    assert_eq!(user, decoded);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Xlang Mode And Native Mode

Use xlang mode for cross-language payloads and schemas shared with other Fory implementations. Xlang mode is the default Rust wire mode, and Rust examples that use it set `.xlang(true)` explicitly so the mode choice is visible.

Use native mode for Rust-only traffic. Native mode is selected with `.xlang(false)` and keeps Rust object serialization in Rust-native form. It supports native-only concrete targets and data-enum shapes that have no xlang representation. Dynamic `Any`, application trait, and shared-reference carriers can also be used in xlang mode when every selected concrete target is xlang-compatible. Compatible mode is enabled by default. Set `.compatible(false)` only when every reader and writer uses the same Rust schema and you want faster serialization and smaller size.

See [Cross-Language Interoperability](basic-serialization.md#cross-language-interoperability) for Rust xlang registration and interoperability rules, and [Native Serialization](native.md) for Rust-only payloads.

## Thread Safety

Apache Fory™ Rust is fully thread-safe: `Fory` implements both `Send` and `Sync`, so one configured instance can be shared across threads for concurrent work. The internal read/write context pools are lazily initialized with thread-safe primitives, letting worker threads reuse buffers without coordination.

```rust
use fory::{Fory, Error};
use fory::ForyStruct;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

#[derive(ForyStruct, Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Item {
    value: i32,
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let mut fory = Fory::builder().xlang(true).build();
    fory.register::<Item>(1000)?;

    let fory = Arc::new(fory);
    let handles: Vec<_> = (0..8)
        .map(|i| {
            let shared = Arc::clone(&fory);
            thread::spawn(move || {
                let item = Item { value: i };
                shared.serialize(&item)
            })
        })
        .collect();

    for handle in handles {
        let bytes = handle.join().unwrap()?;
        let item: Item = fory.deserialize(&bytes)?;
        assert!(item.value >= 0);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Tip:** Perform registrations (such as `fory.register::<T>(id)`) before spawning threads so every worker sees the same metadata. Once configured, wrapping the instance in `Arc` is enough to fan out serialization and deserialization tasks safely.

## Use Cases
