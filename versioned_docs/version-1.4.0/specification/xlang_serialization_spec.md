## Cross-language Serialization Specification

Apache Fory™ xlang serialization enables automatic cross-language object serialization with support for shared references, circular references, and polymorphism. Unlike traditional serialization frameworks that require IDL definitions and schema compilation, Fory serializes objects directly without any intermediate steps.

Key characteristics:

- **Automatic**: No IDL definition, no schema compilation, no manual object-to-protocol conversion
- **Cross-language**: Same binary format works across Java, Python, C++, Go,
  Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Swift, Dart, Scala, and Kotlin
- **Reference-aware**: Handles shared references and circular references without duplication or infinite recursion
- **Polymorphic**: Supports object polymorphism with concrete type resolution

This specification defines the Fory xlang binary format. The format is dynamic rather than static, which enables flexibility and ease of use at the cost of additional complexity in the wire format.

## Type Systems

### Data Types

- bool: a boolean value (true or false).
- int8: a 8-bit signed integer.
- int16: a 16-bit signed integer.
- int32: a 32-bit signed integer. Scalar type expressions may use fixed or varint encoding.
- int64: a 64-bit signed integer. Scalar type expressions may use fixed, varint/PVL, or tagged encoding.
- uint8: an 8-bit unsigned integer.
- uint16: a 16-bit unsigned integer.
- uint32: a 32-bit unsigned integer. Scalar type expressions may use fixed or varint encoding.
- uint64: a 64-bit unsigned integer. Scalar type expressions may use fixed, varint/PVL, or tagged encoding.
- float8: an 8-bit floating point number.
- float16: a 16-bit floating point number.
- bfloat16: a 16-bit brain floating point number.
- float32: a 32-bit floating point number.
- float64: a 64-bit floating point number including NaN and Infinity.
- string: a text string encoded using Latin1/UTF16/UTF-8 encoding.
- enum: a data type consisting of a set of named values. Rust enum with non-predefined field values are not supported as
  an enum.
- named_enum: an enum whose value will be serialized as the registered name.
- struct: a dynamic(final) type serialized by Fory Struct serializer. i.e. it doesn't have subclasses. Suppose we're
  deserializing `List<SomeClass>`, we can save dynamic serializer dispatch since `SomeClass` is dynamic(final).
- compatible_struct: a dynamic(final) type serialized by Fory compatible Struct serializer.
- named_struct: a `struct` whose type mapping will be encoded as a name.
- named_compatible_struct: a `compatible_struct` whose type mapping will be encoded as a name.
- ext: a type which will be serialized by a customized serializer.
- named_ext: an `ext` type whose type mapping will be encoded as a name.
- list: a sequence of objects.
- set: an unordered set of unique elements.
- map: a map of key-value pairs. Map keys do not allow binary values, floating-point values,
  decimal values, or collection-shaped values such as `list`, `map`, `set`, and `array`.
- duration: an absolute length of time, independent of any calendar/timezone, as a count of nanoseconds.
- timestamp: a point in time, independent of any calendar/timezone, encoded as seconds (int64) and nanoseconds
  (uint32) since the epoch at UTC midnight on January 1, 1970.
- date: a naive date without timezone, encoded as a signed varint64 count of days since the Unix epoch.
- decimal: an exact decimal value encoded as a signed `scale` and an exact `unscaled` integer.
- binary: an variable-length array of bytes.
- array: `array<T>` is dense one-dimensional bool or numeric data. Current xlang emits the canonical specialized
  `*_ARRAY` type IDs for each supported element domain. `ARRAY (42)` is reserved for a future generic array encoding and
  is not emitted by the current xlang format. `list<T>` remains a separate schema kind.
  - bool_array: canonical wire tag for `array<bool>`.
  - int8_array: canonical wire tag for `array<int8>`.
  - int16_array: canonical wire tag for `array<int16>`.
  - int32_array: canonical wire tag for `array<int32>`.
  - int64_array: canonical wire tag for `array<int64>`.
  - uint8_array: canonical wire tag for `array<uint8>`.
  - uint16_array: canonical wire tag for `array<uint16>`.
  - uint32_array: canonical wire tag for `array<uint32>`.
  - uint64_array: canonical wire tag for `array<uint64>`.
  - float8_array: reserved canonical wire tag for `array<float8>`.
  - float16_array: canonical wire tag for `array<float16>`.
  - bfloat16_array: canonical wire tag for `array<bfloat16>`.
  - float32_array: canonical wire tag for `array<float32>`.
  - float64_array: canonical wire tag for `array<float64>`.
- union: a tagged union type that can hold one of several alternative types. The active alternative is identified by a non-negative case ID.
- typed_union: a union value with registered numeric union type ID.
- named_union: a union value with embedded union type name or shared TypeDef.
- none: represents an empty/unit value with no data (e.g., for empty union alternatives).

Note:

- Unsigned integer types use the same byte sizes as their signed counterparts; the difference is in value interpretation. See [Type mapping](xlang_type_mapping.md) for language-specific type mappings.

### Polymorphisms

For polymorphism, if one non-final class is registered, and only one subclass is registered, then we can take all
elements in List/Map have same type, thus reduce per-element type checks.

Collection/Array polymorphism are not fully supported, since some languages such as golang have only one collection
type. If users want to get exactly the type he passed, he must pass that type when deserializing or annotate that type
to the field of struct.

### Type disambiguation

Due to differences between type systems of languages, those types can't be mapped one-to-one between languages. When
deserializing, Fory use the target data structure type and the data type in the data jointly to determine how to
deserialize and populate the target data structure. For example:

```java
class Foo {
  int[] intArray;
  Object[] objects;
  List<Object> objectList;
}

class Foo2 {
  int[] intArray;
  List<Object> objects;
  List<Object> objectList;
}
```

`intArray` has `array<int32>` schema and uses the `int32_array` wire tag. Both `objects` and `objectList` have `list`
schema. These schema kinds are distinct; implementations must not treat general object arrays as dense numeric arrays.

### List and Array Semantics

`list<T>` and `array<T>` are different schema kinds.

Use `list<T>` for ordinary ordered collections whose elements may need collection
semantics, nullable element handling, reference handling, or object/string/bytes
payloads. A primitive `list<T>` may still use an optimized homogeneous element
segment internally, but the payload is owned by the list protocol and carries
list metadata.

Use `array<T>` for dynamic-length dense one-dimensional bool or numeric data.
`array<T>` elements are always non-null, non-reference-tracked, and fixed-width
by the array contract. `array<bool>` uses one byte per value. Integer arrays use
fixed-width little-endian element payloads even when the scalar `int32`,
`int64`, `uint32`, or `uint64` default encoding is varint/PVL in scalar or list
positions.

Valid `array<T>` element domains are:

```text
bool
int8, int16, int32, int64
uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
float16, bfloat16, float32, float64
```

Invalid array schemas include `array<fixed int32>`,
`array<optional int32>`, `array<ref T>`, `array<string>`, `array<bytes>`,
`array<map<...>>`, and arrays of structs, unions, enums, temporal values,
decimals, or dynamic `any` values.

The current wire format keeps specialized primitive-array type IDs as the
canonical dynamic tags for `array<T>`:

| Schema            | Dynamic wire tag |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `array<bool>`     | `BOOL_ARRAY`     |
| `array<int8>`     | `INT8_ARRAY`     |
| `array<int16>`    | `INT16_ARRAY`    |
| `array<int32>`    | `INT32_ARRAY`    |
| `array<int64>`    | `INT64_ARRAY`    |
| `array<uint8>`    | `UINT8_ARRAY`    |
| `array<uint16>`   | `UINT16_ARRAY`   |
| `array<uint32>`   | `UINT32_ARRAY`   |
| `array<uint64>`   | `UINT64_ARRAY`   |
| `array<float16>`  | `FLOAT16_ARRAY`  |
| `array<bfloat16>` | `BFLOAT16_ARRAY` |
| `array<float32>`  | `FLOAT32_ARRAY`  |
| `array<float64>`  | `FLOAT64_ARRAY`  |

`ARRAY (42)` is reserved for a future generic or shaped-array descriptor and is
not emitted for dense primitive arrays.

In schema-compatible mode only, a matched struct/class field may read between
direct top-level `list<T>` and direct top-level `array<T>` schemas when `T`
belongs to the valid dense array element domains above. Integer list element
encodings in the same signedness and width domain match the corresponding dense
array element domain. This is a read adaptation, not a schema-kind merge:
writers keep emitting their local canonical `list<T>` or `array<T>` payload, and
TypeDef/ClassDef encodings, fingerprints, dynamic root serialization,
same-schema mode, and unknown-field skipping continue to treat `list<T>`
and `array<T>` as distinct kinds.

The adaptation is limited to the immediate schema of the matched compatible
field. It does not apply when `list<T>` or `array<T>` appears inside another
field type, including collection elements, map keys or values, array elements,
union alternatives, or other generic/container positions. A peer `list<T?>`
TypeDef element schema is not immediate schema incompatibility for a local
matched `array<T>` field. Classification must accept the matched field when the
element domains match and the only element-schema difference is nullable
metadata. The reader must decide from the collection payload: if the payload
actually carries a null element, the local `array<T>` field must raise a
compatible-read error. Null list elements must not be coerced to dense-array
default values. Reference-tracked list-element framing is separate from
nullable element schema. A runtime that cannot materialize ref-tracked list
elements into a dense array without generic/reference paths may reject that
field during compatible classification; if it accepts the field, reference
payloads that cannot be represented as dense array element values must fail
during read.

The dense-array error rule applies to dense-array targets. A matched
`list<T?>` field read into a local `list<T?>` target must keep using list
semantics and preserve actual null elements; implementations must not route that
payload through a dense primitive-array materialization path that rejects nulls.

In schema-compatible mode only, a matched struct/class field may read between
direct top-level `binary` and direct top-level `array<uint8>` schemas. This is a
byte-sequence adaptation only: it does not merge TypeDef/ClassDef type IDs,
schema fingerprints, dynamic root serialization, same-schema mode, or nested
collection/map/array/union/generic positions. `array<int8>` is not part of this
adapter.

In schema-compatible mode only, a matched struct/class field may also read
between direct top-level scalar schemas when the remote value can be represented
by the local scalar schema without changing the logical value. This is a
compatible read adaptation only: writers keep emitting their local canonical
schema and payload, and TypeDef/ClassDef encodings, fingerprints, dynamic root
serialization, same-schema mode, unknown-field skipping, and container
element schemas continue to treat the original scalar types as distinct.

The scalar conversion rule applies only to the immediate schema of the matched
compatible field. It does not apply to dynamic root values, `any`, map keys, map
values, list elements, set elements, array elements, union alternatives, enum
values, time/date/duration values, binary values, structs, ext values, or nested
generic/container positions. It also applies only when both the remote and local
top-level field schemas have `trackingRef = false`; if either matched field
schema has `trackingRef = true`, scalar conversion is outside the compatible
layout matrix and scalar type changes remain schema/type incompatible. Same
scalar type IDs with matching top-level `trackingRef` and null/optional framing
are exact same-schema direct reads, not compatible scalar conversion. Same
scalar type IDs with different top-level `trackingRef` framing are schema/type
incompatible because the wire framing differs. Same scalar type IDs with
different top-level null/optional framing may still use the nullable/optional
composition rule below when both fields have `trackingRef = false`.

The convertible scalar domains are `bool`, `string`, and numeric scalars.
Numeric scalars are signed integers (`int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`),
unsigned integers (`uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`), floating point
(`float16`, `bfloat16`, `float32`, `float64`), and `decimal`. Integer encoding
variants are the same semantic domain as their base width: fixed, variable, and
tagged integer encodings do not create additional conversion domains.

Compatible scalar conversion MUST follow these rules:

- `string` to `bool` accepts exactly `"0"`, `"1"`, `"false"`, and `"true"`.
  The match is byte-for-byte ASCII; readers MUST NOT trim whitespace, accept a
  leading sign, accept other letter case, or use locale-specific text.
- `bool` to `string` produces canonical lower-case `"false"` or `"true"`.
- numeric to `bool` accepts only exact numeric zero and exact numeric one. `NaN`
  and infinities fail. Negative floating zero is zero. Decimal scale does not
  affect the zero/one check.
- `bool` to numeric produces exact zero or one in the local numeric domain.
- numeric to numeric succeeds only when the local numeric domain represents the
  same mathematical value. Integer conversions check target range and signedness;
  integer-to-floating conversions check exact representability in the target
  floating domain; floating-to-integer conversions require a finite integral
  value within range; floating-to-floating conversions require exact
  preservation after converting to the target and back to the source, including
  the sign of zero. Floating infinities may convert only when the target floating
  domain preserves the same infinity. `NaN` is not convertible across different
  floating type IDs.
- decimal is an exact numeric scalar. Integer-to-decimal conversion uses scale
  `0`; decimal-to-integer conversion requires an integral value in range;
  floating-to-decimal conversion requires a finite value and converts the exact
  binary floating value to canonical decimal form; decimal-to-floating
  conversion requires exact representability in the target floating domain.
  Same-type decimal reads preserve the ordinary decimal payload. Decimal values
  produced by conversion use the canonical converted decimal form below.
- `string` to numeric accepts only the compatible numeric literal grammar below
  and then applies the same lossless target-domain checks. `"NaN"`,
  `"Infinity"`, `"-Infinity"`, and spelling variants fail because numeric
  strings are finite-only.
- numeric to `string` emits canonical finite numeric text. Integer sources emit
  decimal text with no leading zeros except `"0"`. Floating sources emit exact
  plain decimal text that equals the source value and parses back to the same
  source floating type; it includes a decimal point and at least one fractional
  digit, preserves negative zero as `"-0.0"`, never uses exponent notation, and
  fails for `NaN` and infinities. Decimal sources emit exact plain decimal text
  with no exponent and no insignificant trailing fractional zeros; decimal zero
  is `"0"`.

The compatible numeric literal grammar is deliberately stricter than host
language parsers:

- no leading or trailing whitespace;
- no leading plus sign;
- ASCII grammar only: signs, digits, decimal points, and exponent markers are
  the ASCII bytes `-`, `0` through `9`, `.`, `e`, and `E`;
- no Unicode decimal digits, underscores, grouping separators, locale-specific
  digits, hexadecimal, octal, binary, or type suffixes;
- integer literal: `-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)`;
- decimal floating literal:
  `-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.[0-9]+([eE]-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*))?` or
  `-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)[eE]-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)`.

Readers MUST parse numeric strings with exact decimal, rational, or equivalent
checked algorithms. Parsing through a host floating type and then casting is not
valid unless the implementation also proves exactness against the original
literal.

Canonical converted decimal form is:

- zero: `unscaled = 0`, `scale = 0`;
- non-zero integers: `scale = 0` and the integer as `unscaled`;
- finite fractional values: the smallest non-negative scale whose
  `unscaled * 10^-scale` equals the value and whose `unscaled` is not divisible
  by `10`.

Compatible scalar conversion MUST reject a numeric string before arbitrary
precision parsing when the raw string length is greater than `320`. It MUST also
reject a converted decimal before constructing large powers of ten or formatting
plain decimal text when its canonical converted form would require an exponent or
scale outside `[-256, 256]`, a positive scale greater than `256`, an unscaled
decimal magnitude with more than `256` significant digits, or a negative scale
whose formatted integer digit count would exceed `256`. These bounds apply only
to values produced by compatible scalar conversion, including string-to-decimal,
decimal-to-string, and floating-to-decimal conversion. Same-type decimal reads
preserve the ordinary decimal payload. A bounded public decimal carrier may
reject smaller values when it cannot represent the value exactly.

Nullable, boxed, optional, and nullable-field composition is supported for
matched scalar pairs whose top-level field schemas have `trackingRef = false`.
Readers first consume the remote null/optional framing described by the remote
field metadata. If a value is present, the reader converts the unwrapped scalar
value and then assigns or wraps it into the local carrier. If the remote value
is null or absent, the reader uses the same missing/null compatible-field rule
it already applies for that local field; this feature does not introduce a
second null policy. Reference-tracked scalar conversion is not supported.

Conversion failures are data errors, not schema misses. A schema pair outside
the conversion matrix remains a schema/type compatibility error when building
the compatible layout. Once a matched field is accepted as a scalar conversion
action, an invalid payload value MUST be reported through the implementation's
data-error path with enough context to identify the remote type, local type, and
field when that path has the information.

Unknown-field skipping applies only when the remote field has no matching local
field identity. If a local field matches by tag ID or name but its schema is
outside the exact-read and compatible-adaptation rules, the reader MUST reject
the compatible layout instead of treating the field as missing, remote-only, or
skippable.

Users can also provide meta hints for fields of a type, or the type whole. Here is an example in java which use
annotation to provide such information.

```java
@ForyStruct
class Foo {
  @ArrayType
  @ForyField(id = 0)
  int[] intArray;

  @ForyField(id = 1, dynamic = ForyField.Dynamic.TRUE)
  Object object;

  @Nullable
  @ForyField(id = 2)
  List<Object> objectList;
}
```

Such information can be provided in other languages too:

- cpp: use macro and template.
- golang: use struct tag.
- python: use typehint.
- rust: use macro.

### Type ID

All internal data types use an 8-bit internal ID (`0~255`, with `0~56` defined here). Users can
register types by numeric ID (`0~0xFFFFFFFE` in current implementations). User IDs are encoded
separately from the internal type ID; there is no bit shifting/packing.

Named types (`NAMED_*`) do not embed a user ID; their names are carried in metadata instead.

#### Type ID Encoding for User Types

When registering user types (struct/ext/enum/union), the internal type ID is written as the 8-bit
kind. The user type ID is written separately as an unsigned varint32 (small7); there is no bit
shift or packing.

**Examples:**

| User ID | Type              | Internal ID | Encoded User ID | Decimal |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------- |
| 0       | STRUCT            | 27          | 0               | 0       |
| 0       | ENUM              | 25          | 0               | 0       |
| 1       | STRUCT            | 27          | 1               | 1       |
| 1       | COMPATIBLE_STRUCT | 28          | 1               | 1       |
| 2       | NAMED_STRUCT      | 29          | 2               | 2       |

When reading type IDs:

- Read internal type ID from the type ID field.
- If the internal type is a user-registered kind, read `user_type_id` as varuint32.

### Type mapping

See [Type mapping](xlang_type_mapping.md)

## Spec overview

Here is the overall format:

```
| fory header | object ref meta | object type meta | object value data |
```

The data are serialized using little endian byte order for all types.

## Fory header

Fory header format for xlang serialization:

```
|        1 byte bitmap           |
+--------------------------------+
|            flags               |
```

Detailed byte layout:

```
Byte 0:   Bitmap flags
          - Bit 0: xlang flag (0x01)
          - Bit 1: oob flag (0x02)
          - Bits 2-7: reserved
```

- **xlang flag** (bit 0): 1 when serialization uses Fory xlang format, 0 when serialization uses a Fory native-mode format.
- **oob flag** (bit 1): 1 when out-of-band serialization is enabled (BufferCallback is not null), 0 otherwise.
- **reserved bits** (bits 2-7): must be zero.

All data is encoded in little-endian format.

## Reference Meta

Reference tracking handles whether the object is null, and whether to track reference for the object by writing
corresponding flags and maintaining internal state.

### Reference Flags

| Flag                | Byte Value (int8) | Hex    | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NULL FLAG           | `-3`              | `0xFD` | Object is null. No further bytes are written for this object.                                            |
| REF FLAG            | `-2`              | `0xFE` | Object was already serialized. Followed by unsigned varint32 reference ID.                               |
| NOT_NULL VALUE FLAG | `-1`              | `0xFF` | Object is non-null but reference tracking is disabled for this type. Object data follows immediately.    |
| REF VALUE FLAG      | `0`               | `0x00` | Object is referencable and this is its first occurrence. Object data follows. Assigns next reference ID. |

### Reference Tracking Algorithm

**Writing:**

```
function write_ref_or_null(buffer, obj):
    if obj is null:
        buffer.write_int8(NULL_FLAG)      // -3
        return true  // done, no more data to write

    if reference_tracking_enabled:
        ref_id = lookup_written_objects(obj)
        if ref_id exists:
            buffer.write_int8(REF_FLAG)   // -2
            buffer.write_varuint32(ref_id)
            return true  // done, reference written
        else:
            buffer.write_int8(REF_VALUE_FLAG)  // 0
            add_to_written_objects(obj, next_ref_id++)
            return false  // continue to serialize object data
    else:
        buffer.write_int8(NOT_NULL_VALUE_FLAG)  // -1
        return false  // continue to serialize object data
```

**Reading:**

```
function read_ref_or_null(buffer):
    flag = buffer.read_int8()
    switch flag:
        case NULL_FLAG (-3):
            return (null, true)  // null object, done
        case REF_FLAG (-2):
            ref_id = buffer.read_varuint32()
            obj = get_from_read_objects(ref_id)
            return (obj, true)  // referenced object, done
        case NOT_NULL_VALUE_FLAG (-1):
            return (null, false)  // non-null, continue reading
        case REF_VALUE_FLAG (0):
            reserve_ref_slot()  // will be filled after reading
            return (null, false)  // non-null, continue reading
```

### Reference ID Assignment

- Reference IDs are assigned sequentially starting from `0`
- The ID is assigned when `REF_VALUE_FLAG` is written (first occurrence)
- Objects are stored in a list/map indexed by their reference ID
- For reading, a reference slot is reserved before deserializing the object, then filled after

### When Reference Tracking is Disabled

When reference tracking is disabled globally or for specific types, only the `NULL` and `NOT_NULL VALUE` flags
will be used for reference meta. This reduces overhead for types that are known not to have references.

### Language-Specific Considerations

**Languages with nullable and reference types by default (Java, Python, JavaScript):**

In xlang mode, for cross-language compatibility:

- All fields are treated as **not-null** by default
- Reference tracking is **disabled** by default
- Users can explicitly mark fields as nullable or enable reference tracking via annotations
- `Optional` types (e.g., `java.util.Optional`, `typing.Optional`) are treated as nullable

**Annotation examples:**

```java
// Java: use @Ref for reference tracking
public class MyClass {
    @Nullable
    @Ref
    private Object refField;

    private String requiredField;
}
```

```python
# Python: use typing with fory field descriptors
from pyfory import ForyField, Ref

class MyClass:
    ref_field: ForyField(Ref[SomeType], nullable=True)
    required_field: ForyField(str, nullable=False)
```

**Languages with non-nullable types by default:**

| Language | Null Representation       | Reference Tracking Support              |
| -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Rust     | `Option::None`            | Via `Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>`, `Weak<T>`        |
| C++      | `std::nullopt`, `nullptr` | Via `std::shared_ptr<T>`, `weak_ptr<T>` |
| Go       | `nil` interface/pointer   | Via pointer/interface types             |

**Important:** For languages like Rust that don't have implicit reference semantics, reference tracking must use
explicit smart pointers (`Rc`, `Arc`).

## Type Meta

Every non-primitive value begins with a type ID that identifies its concrete type. The type ID is
followed by optional type-specific metadata.

### Type ID encoding

- The type ID is written as an unsigned varint32 (small7).
- Internal types use their internal type ID directly (low 8 bits).
- User-registered types write the internal type ID, then write `user_type_id` as varuint32.
  - `user_type_id` is a numeric ID (0~0xFFFFFFFE in current implementations).
  - `internal_type_id` is one of `ENUM`, `STRUCT`, `COMPATIBLE_STRUCT`, `EXT`, or `TYPED_UNION`.
- Named types do not embed a user ID. They use `NAMED_*` internal type IDs and carry a namespace
  and type name (or shared TypeDef) instead.

### Type meta payload

After the type ID:

- **ENUM / STRUCT / EXT / TYPED_UNION**: no extra bytes beyond the `user_type_id` (registration by ID required on both sides).
- **COMPATIBLE_STRUCT**:
  - If meta share is enabled, write a shared TypeDef entry (see below).
  - If meta share is disabled, no extra bytes.
- **NAMED_ENUM / NAMED_STRUCT / NAMED_COMPATIBLE_STRUCT / NAMED_EXT / NAMED_UNION**:
  - If meta share is disabled, write `namespace` and `type_name` as meta strings.
  - If meta share is enabled, write a shared TypeDef entry (see below).
- **UNION**: no extra bytes at this layer.
- **LIST / SET / MAP / primitives**: no extra bytes at this layer.

Pure id-based enum, ext, and typed-union values therefore do not carry a TypeDef
body. Receive-side TypeDef resource limits apply only when the stream actually
carries shared TypeDef metadata.

`ARRAY (42)` is reserved for a future xlang extension for dedicated multi-dimensional arrays and
is not used in current xlang streams.

Unregistered types are serialized as named types:

- Enums -> `NAMED_ENUM`
- Struct-like classes -> `NAMED_STRUCT` (or `NAMED_COMPATIBLE_STRUCT` when meta share is enabled)
- Custom extension types -> `NAMED_EXT`
- Unions -> `NAMED_UNION`

The namespace is the package/module name and the type name is the simple class name.

### Shared Type Meta (streaming)

When meta share is enabled, TypeDef metadata is written inline the first time a type is
encountered, and subsequent occurrences only reference it.

Encoding:

- `marker = (index << 1) | flag`
- `flag = 0`: new type definition follows
- `flag = 1`: reference to a previously written type definition
- `index` is the sequential index assigned to this type (starting from 0).

Write algorithm:

1. Look up the class in the per-stream meta context map.
2. If found, write `(index << 1) | 1`.
3. If not found:
   - assign `index = next_id`
   - write `(index << 1)`
   - write the encoded TypeDef bytes immediately after

Read algorithm:

1. Read `marker` as varuint32.
2. `flag = marker & 1`, `index = marker >>> 1`.
3. If `flag == 1`, use the cached TypeDef at `index`.
4. If `flag == 0`, read a TypeDef, cache it at `index`, and use it.

TypeDef bytes include the 8-byte global header and optional size extension.

### TypeDef (schema evolution metadata)

TypeDef describes a struct-like type (or a named enum/ext) for schema evolution and name
resolution. It is encoded as:

```
|    8-byte global header   | [optional size varuint] | TypeDef body |
```

#### Global header

The 8-byte header is a little-endian uint64:

- Low 8 bits: meta size (number of bytes in the TypeDef body).
  - If meta size >= 0xFF, the low 8 bits are set to 0xFF and an extra
    `varuint32(meta_size - 0xFF)` follows immediately after the header.
- Bit 8: `COMPRESS_META` is reserved for a future xlang metadata-compression extension.
  Current xlang writers MUST leave this bit unset and current xlang readers MUST treat a set bit
  as unsupported.
- Bits 9-11: reserved for future extension (must be zero).
- High 52 bits: stored hash bits derived from MurmurHash3 x64_128 seed 47 over
  `TypeDef body || header_low12_le`. `header_low12_le` is two little-endian bytes containing the low
  12 header bits (size, compress, and reserved bits); the upper four bits of the second byte are
  zero. Take lane 0 of the 128-bit MurmurHash3 result as a signed int64, left-shift it by 12 with
  two's-complement 64-bit wraparound, apply signed absolute value (leaving `INT64_MIN` unchanged),
  then mask with `0xfffffffffffff000`. The final header is the masked hash bits OR-ed with the low
  12 header bits.

#### TypeDef body

TypeDef body has a single layer (fields are flattened in class hierarchy order):

```
| meta header (1 byte) | type spec | field info ... |
```

Meta header byte for struct TypeDefs:

- Bit 7: `IS_STRUCT` (1).
- Bit 6: `COMPATIBLE`.
- Bit 5: `REGISTER_BY_NAME` (1 = namespace + type name, 0 = numeric user type ID).
- Bits 0-4: `num_fields` (0-30).
  - If `num_fields == 31`, read an extra `varuint32` and add it.

Meta header byte for non-struct TypeDefs:

- Bit 7: `IS_STRUCT` (0).
- Bits 4-6: reserved (must be zero).
- Bits 0-3: kind code.

Readers may reject a received TypeDef that exceeds runtime resource limits such
as maximum metadata body bytes or maximum fields in one struct TypeDef. These
limits are receive-side resource controls and do not change TypeDef wire
encoding, type identity, dynamic loading, unknown-type handling, registration
policy, or schema-evolution semantics.

Non-struct kind codes:

- `0`: `ENUM`
- `1`: `NAMED_ENUM`
- `2`: `EXT`
- `3`: `NAMED_EXT`
- `4`: `TYPED_UNION`
- `5`: `NAMED_UNION`
- `6-14`: reserved
- `15`: extended-kind escape, rejected until defined

Type spec:

- If `REGISTER_BY_NAME` is set:
  - `namespace` meta string
  - `type_name` meta string
- Otherwise:
  - user type ID as `varuint32`

Field info list:

Each field is encoded as:

```
| field header (1 byte) | field type info | [field name bytes] |
```

Field header layout:

- Bits 6-7: field name encoding (`UTF8`, `ALL_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL`,
  `LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL`, or `TAG_ID`)
- Bits 2-5: size
  - For name encoding: `size = (name_bytes_length - 1)`
  - For tag ID: `size = tag_id`
  - If `size == 0b1111`, read `varuint32(size - 15)` and add it
- Bit 1: nullable flag
- Bit 0: reference tracking flag

Field type info:

- The top-level field type is written as `varuint32(type_id)` (small7) without flags.
- For `LIST` / `SET`, an element type follows, encoded as
  `(nested_type_id << 2) | (nullable << 1) | tracking_ref`.
- For `MAP`, key type and value type follow, both encoded the same way.
- One-dimensional primitive arrays use `*_ARRAY` type IDs; other arrays are encoded as `LIST`.

Field names:

- If `TAG_ID` encoding is used, no name bytes are written.
- Otherwise, write the encoded field name bytes as a meta string.
- For xlang, field names are converted to `snake_case` before encoding for
  cross-language compatibility.

Field order:

TypeDef field lists use the same ordering defined in [Field order](#field-order). Compatible
decoders must still match fields by name or tag ID rather than relying only on position.

## Meta String

Meta string is a compressed encoding for metadata strings such as field names, type names, and namespaces.
This compression significantly reduces the size of type metadata in serialized data.

### Encoding Type IDs

| ID  | Name                      | Bits/Char | Character Set                        |
| --- | ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0   | UTF8                      | 8         | Any UTF-8 character                  |
| 1   | LOWER_SPECIAL             | 5         | `a-z . _ $ \|`                       |
| 2   | LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL | 6         | `a-z A-Z 0-9 . _`                    |
| 3   | FIRST_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL    | 5         | First char uppercase, rest `a-z . _` |
| 4   | ALL_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL      | 5         | `a-z A-Z . _` (uppercase escaped)    |

### Character Mapping Tables

#### LOWER_SPECIAL (5 bits per character)

| Character | Code (binary) | Code (decimal) |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| a-z       | 00000-11001   | 0-25           |
| .         | 11010         | 26             |
| \_        | 11011         | 27             |
| $         | 11100         | 28             |
| \|        | 11101         | 29             |

**Note:** The `|` character is used as an escape sequence in ALL_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL encoding.

#### LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL (6 bits per character)

| Character | Code (binary) | Code (decimal) |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| a-z       | 000000-011001 | 0-25           |
| A-Z       | 011010-110011 | 26-51          |
| 0-9       | 110100-111101 | 52-61          |
| .         | 111110        | 62             |
| \_        | 111111        | 63             |

### Encoding Algorithms

#### LOWER_SPECIAL Encoding

For strings containing only `a-z`, `.`, `_`, `$`, `|`:

```
function encode_lower_special(str):
    bits = []
    for char in str:
        bits.append(lookup_lower_special[char])  // 5 bits each

    // Pad to byte boundary
    total_bits = len(str) * 5
    padding_bits = (8 - (total_bits % 8)) % 8

    // First bit indicates if last char should be stripped (due to padding)
    strip_last = (padding_bits >= 5)
    if strip_last:
        prepend bit 1
    else:
        prepend bit 0

    return pack_bits_to_bytes(bits)
```

#### FIRST_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL Encoding

For strings like `MyFieldName` where only the first character is uppercase:

```
function encode_first_to_lower_special(str):
    // Convert first char to lowercase
    modified = str[0].lower() + str[1:]
    // Then use LOWER_SPECIAL encoding
    return encode_lower_special(modified)
```

#### ALL_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL Encoding

For strings with multiple uppercase characters like `MyTypeName`:

```
function encode_all_to_lower_special(str):
    result = ""
    for char in str:
        if char.is_upper():
            result += "|" + char.lower()  // Escape uppercase with |
        else:
            result += char
    return encode_lower_special(result)
```

Example: `MyType` → `|my|type` → encoded with LOWER_SPECIAL

### Encoding Selection Algorithm

```
function choose_encoding(str):
    if all chars in str are in [a-z . _ $ |]:
        return LOWER_SPECIAL

    if first char is uppercase AND rest are in [a-z . _]:
        return FIRST_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL

    if all chars are in [a-z A-Z . _]:
        lower_special_size = encode_all_to_lower_special(str).size
        luds_size = encode_lower_upper_digit_special(str).size
        if lower_special_size <= luds_size:
            return ALL_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL
        else:
            return LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL

    if all chars are in [a-z A-Z 0-9 . _]:
        return LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL

    return UTF8
```

### Meta String Header Format

Meta strings are written with a header that includes the encoding type:

```
| 3 bits encoding | 5+ bits length | encoded bytes |
```

Or for larger strings:

```
| varuint: (length << 3) | encoding | encoded bytes |
```

### Special Character Sets by Context

Different contexts use different special characters:

| Context    | Special Chars | Notes                              |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Field Name | . \_ $ \|     | $ for inner classes, \| for escape |
| Namespace  | . \_          | Package/module separators          |
| Type Name  | $ \_          | $ for inner classes in Java        |

### Deduplication

Meta strings are deduplicated within a serialization session:

```
First occurrence:  | (length << 1) | [hash if large] | encoding | bytes |
Reference:         | ((id + 1) << 1) | 1 |
```

- Bit 0 of the header indicates: 0 = new string, 1 = reference to previous
- Large strings (> 16 bytes) include 64-bit hash for content-based deduplication
- Small strings use exact byte comparison

## Value Format

### Basic types

#### bool

- size: 1 byte
- format: 0 for `false`, 1 for `true`

#### int8

- size: 1 byte
- format: write as pure byte.

#### int16

- size: 2 byte
- byte order: raw bytes of little endian order

#### unsigned int32

- size: 4 byte
- byte order: raw bytes of little endian order

#### unsigned varint32

- size: 1~5 bytes
- Format: The most significant bit (MSB) in every byte indicates whether to have the next byte. If the continuation
  bit is set (i.e. `b & 0x80 == 0x80`), then the next byte should be read until a byte with unset continuation bit.

**Encoding Algorithm:**

```
function write_varuint32(value):
    while value >= 0x80:
        buffer.write_byte((value & 0x7F) | 0x80)  // 7 bits of data + continuation bit
        value = value >> 7
    buffer.write_byte(value)  // final byte without continuation bit
```

**Decoding Algorithm:**

```
function read_varuint32():
    result = 0
    shift = 0
    while true:
        byte = buffer.read_byte()
        result = result | ((byte & 0x7F) << shift)
        if (byte & 0x80) == 0:
            break
        shift = shift + 7
    return result
```

**Byte sizes by value range:**

| Value Range            | Bytes |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| 0 ~ 127                | 1     |
| 128 ~ 16383            | 2     |
| 16384 ~ 2097151        | 3     |
| 2097152 ~ 268435455    | 4     |
| 268435456 ~ 4294967295 | 5     |

#### signed int32

- size: 4 bytes
- byte order: raw bytes of little endian order

#### signed varint32

- size: 1~5 bytes
- Format: First convert the number into positive unsigned int using ZigZag encoding, then encode as unsigned varint.

**ZigZag Encoding:**

```
// Encode: convert signed to unsigned
zigzag_value = (value << 1) ^ (value >> 31)

// Decode: convert unsigned back to signed
original = (zigzag_value >> 1) ^ (-(zigzag_value & 1))
// Or equivalently:
original = (zigzag_value >> 1) ^ (~(zigzag_value & 1) + 1)
```

ZigZag encoding maps signed integers to unsigned integers so that small absolute values (positive or negative)
have small encoded values:

| Original | ZigZag Encoded |
| -------- | -------------- |
| 0        | 0              |
| -1       | 1              |
| 1        | 2              |
| -2       | 3              |
| 2        | 4              |
| ...      | ...            |

#### unsigned int64

- size: 8 bytes
- byte order: raw bytes of little endian order

#### unsigned varint64

- size: 1~9 bytes

Uses PVL (Progressive Variable-Length) encoding:

```
function write_varuint64(value):
    while value >= 0x80:
        buffer.write_byte((value & 0x7F) | 0x80)
        value = value >> 7
    buffer.write_byte(value)
```

| Value Range   | Bytes |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 0 ~ 127       | 1     |
| 128 ~ 16383   | 2     |
| ...           | ...   |
| 2^56 ~ 2^63-1 | 9     |

#### unsigned hybrid int64 (TAGGED_UINT64)

- size: 4 or 9 bytes

Optimized for unsigned values that fit in 31 bits (common case for IDs, sizes, counts, etc.):

```
if value in [0, 2147483647]:  // fits in 31 bits (2^31 - 1), full unsigned range
    write 4 bytes: ((int32) value) << 1  // bit 0 is 0, indicating 4-byte encoding
else:
    write 1 byte:  0x01                  // bit 0 is 1, indicating 9-byte encoding
    write 8 bytes: value as little-endian uint64
```

Reading:

```
first_int32 = read_int32_le()
if (first_int32 & 1) == 0:
    return (uint64)(first_int32 >> 1)  // 4-byte encoding, unsigned
else:
    return read_uint64_le()            // read remaining 8 bytes
```

Note: TAGGED_UINT64 uses the full 31 bits for positive values [0, 2^31-1], compared to TAGGED_INT64 which splits the range for signed values [-2^30, 2^30-1].

#### VarUint36Small

A specialized encoding used for string headers that combines size (up to 36 bits) with encoding flags:

```
// Write: encodes (size << 2) | encoding_flags
function write_varuint36_small(value):
    if value < 0x80:
        buffer.write_byte(value)
    else:
        // Standard varint encoding for values >= 128
        write_varuint64(value)
```

This encoding is optimized for the common case where string length fits in 7 bits (strings < 32 characters).

#### signed int64

- size: 8 bytes
- byte order: raw bytes of little endian order

#### signed varint64

- size: 1~9 bytes

Uses ZigZag encoding first, then PVL varint:

```
// Encode
zigzag_value = (value << 1) ^ (value >> 63)
write_varuint64(zigzag_value)

// Decode
zigzag_value = read_varuint64()
value = (zigzag_value >> 1) ^ (-(zigzag_value & 1))
```

#### signed hybrid int64 (TAGGED_INT64)

- size: 4 or 9 bytes

Optimized for small signed values:

```
if value in [-1073741824, 1073741823]:  // fits in 30 bits + sign ([-2^30, 2^30-1])
    write 4 bytes: ((int32) value) << 1  // bit 0 is 0, indicating 4-byte encoding
else:
    write 1 byte:  0x01                  // bit 0 is 1, indicating 9-byte encoding
    write 8 bytes: value as little-endian int64
```

Reading:

```
first_int32 = read_int32_le()
if (first_int32 & 1) == 0:
    return (int64)(first_int32 >> 1)  // 4-byte encoding, sign-extended
else:
    return read_int64_le()            // read remaining 8 bytes
```

Note: TAGGED_INT64 uses 30 bits + sign for values [-2^30, 2^30-1], while TAGGED_UINT64 uses full 31 bits for unsigned values [0, 2^31-1].

#### float8

- size: 1 byte
- format:
  - float8 has 4 kinds: float8 kind enum: float8_e4m3fn, float8_e4m3fnuz, float8_e5m2, float8_e5m2fnuz
  - when serialize as field, write raw 8 bits as one byte directly
  - when serialize as an object: write type kind as a byte, then write value byte

#### float16

- size: 2 bytes
- format: encode the specified floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 standard binary16 format, preserving NaN values, then write as binary by little endian order.

#### bfloat16

- size: 2 bytes
- format: encode the specified floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 standard bfloat16 format, preserving NaN values, then write as binary by little endian order.

#### float32

- size: 4 byte
- format: encode the specified floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point "single format" bit layout,
  preserving Not-a-Number (NaN) values, then write as binary by little endian order.

#### float64

- size: 8 byte
- format: encode the specified floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point "double format" bit layout,
  preserving Not-a-Number (NaN) values. then write as binary by little endian order.

### string

Format:

```
| varuint36_small: (size << 2) | encoding | binary data |
```

#### String Header

The header is encoded using `varuint36_small` format, which combines the byte length and encoding type:

```
header = (byte_length << 2) | encoding_type
```

| Encoding Type | Value | Description                             |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| LATIN1        | 0     | ISO-8859-1 single-byte encoding         |
| UTF16         | 1     | UTF-16 encoding (2 bytes per code unit) |
| UTF8          | 2     | UTF-8 variable-length encoding          |
| Reserved      | 3     | Reserved for future use                 |

#### Encoding Algorithm

**Writing:**

```
function write_string(str):
    bytes = encode_to_bytes(str, chosen_encoding)
    header = (bytes.length << 2) | encoding_type
    buffer.write_varuint36_small(header)
    buffer.write_bytes(bytes)
```

**Reading:**

```
function read_string():
    header = buffer.read_varuint36_small()
    encoding = header & 0x03
    byte_length = header >> 2
    bytes = buffer.read_bytes(byte_length)
    return decode_bytes(bytes, encoding)
```

#### Encoding Selection by Language

**Writing:**

| Language     | Encoding Strategy                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Java (JDK8)  | Detect at runtime: LATIN1 if all chars < 256, else UTF16 |
| Java (JDK9+) | Use String's internal coder: LATIN1 or UTF16             |
| Python       | Can write LATIN1, UTF16, or UTF8 based on string content |
| C++          | UTF8 (`std::string`) or UTF16 (`std::u16string`)         |
| Rust         | UTF8 (`String`)                                          |
| Go           | UTF8 (`string`)                                          |
| JavaScript   | UTF8                                                     |

**Reading:** All languages support decoding all three encodings (LATIN1, UTF16, UTF8).

**Recommendation:** Select encoding based on maximum performance - use the encoding that matches the language's native string representation to avoid conversion overhead.

#### Empty String

Empty strings are encoded with header `0` (length 0, any encoding) followed by no data bytes.

### duration

Duration is an absolute length of time, independent of any calendar/timezone, as a count of seconds and nanoseconds.

Format:

```
| signed varint64: seconds | signed int32: nanoseconds |
```

- `seconds`: Number of seconds in the duration, encoded as a signed varint64. Can be positive or negative.
- `nanoseconds`: Nanosecond adjustment to the duration, encoded as a signed int32.

Notes:

- The duration is stored as two separate fields to maintain precision and avoid overflow issues.
- Seconds are encoded using varint64 for compact representation of common duration values.
- Nanoseconds are stored as a fixed int32 since the range is limited.

#### Canonical Rules

- Writers MUST normalize durations so `nanoseconds` is always in `[0, 1_000_000_000)`.
- Zero MUST be encoded as `seconds = 0` and `nanoseconds = 0`.
- Negative sub-second durations MUST borrow one second and use a positive nanosecond adjustment.
  Example: `-0.5s` is encoded as `seconds = -1`, `nanoseconds = 500_000_000`.
- More generally, the encoded pair MUST satisfy:
  - `duration = seconds + nanoseconds / 1_000_000_000`
  - `0 <= nanoseconds < 1_000_000_000`

#### Final Value

After decoding `seconds` and `nanoseconds`, the duration value is reconstructed as the exact
duration represented by:

`seconds + nanoseconds / 1_000_000_000`

### collection/list

Format:

```
| varuint32: length | 1 byte elements header | [optional type info] | elements data |
```

#### Elements Header

The elements header is a single byte that encodes metadata about the collection elements to optimize serialization:

```
| bit 7-4 (reserved) |    bit 3    |      bit 2       |   bit 1  |   bit 0   |
+--------------------+-------------+------------------+----------+-----------+
|      reserved      | is_same_type| is_decl_elem_type| has_null | track_ref |
```

| Bit | Name              | Value | Meaning when SET (1)                     | Meaning when UNSET (0)                  |
| --- | ----------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0   | track_ref         | 0x01  | Track references for elements            | Don't track element references          |
| 1   | has_null          | 0x02  | Payload contains null element markers    | No null elements (skip null checks)     |
| 2   | is_decl_elem_type | 0x04  | Elements are the declared generic type   | Element types differ from declared type |
| 3   | is_same_type      | 0x08  | All elements have the same concrete type | Elements have different concrete types  |

**Common header values:**

| Header | Hex | Meaning                                                        |
| ------ | --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x0C   | 12  | Declared type + same type, non-null, no ref tracking (optimal) |
| 0x0D   | 13  | Declared type + same type, non-null, with ref tracking         |
| 0x0E   | 14  | Declared type + same type, may have nulls, no ref tracking     |
| 0x08   | 8   | Same type but not declared type (type info written once)       |
| 0x00   | 0   | Different types, non-null, no ref tracking (type per element)  |

#### Type Info After Header

When `is_decl_elem_type` (bit 2) is NOT set, the element type info is written once after the header if `is_same_type` (bit 3) is set:

```
| header (0x08) | type_id (varuint32) | elements... |
```

When both `is_decl_elem_type` and `is_same_type` are NOT set, type info is written per element.

#### Element Serialization Based on Header

The header determines how each element is serialized:

#### elements data

Based on the elements header, the serialization of elements data may skip `ref flag`/`null flag`/`element type info`.

```python
fory = ...
buffer = ...
elems = ...
if element_type_is_same:
    if not is_declared_type:
        fory.write_type(buffer, elem_type)
    elem_serializer = get_serializer(...)
    if track_ref:
        for elem in elems:
            if not ref_resolver.write_ref_or_null(buffer, elem):
                elem_serializer.write(buffer, elem)
    elif has_null:
        for elem in elems:
            if elem is None:
                buffer.write_byte(null_flag)
            else:
                buffer.write_byte(not_null_flag)
                elem_serializer.write(buffer, elem)
    else:
        for elem in elems:
            elem_serializer.write(buffer, elem)
else:
    if track_ref:
        for elem in elems:
            fory.write_ref(buffer, elem)
    elif has_null:
        for elem in elems:
            fory.write_nullable(buffer, elem)
    else:
        for elem in elems:
            fory.write_value(buffer, elem)
```

[`CollectionSerializer#writeElements`](https://github.com/apache/fory/blob/20a1a78b17a75a123a6f5b7094c06ff77defc0fe/java/fory-core/src/main/java/org/apache/fory/serializer/collection/CollectionLikeSerializer.java#L302)
can be taken as an example.

### array

#### primitive array

Primitive array are taken as a binary buffer, serialization will just write the length of array size as an unsigned int,
then copy the whole buffer into the stream. Multi-byte element arrays are always encoded in little-endian element order;
implementations whose native typed-array storage uses another byte order must swap or write elements explicitly instead of
copying native storage bytes unchanged.

Such serialization won't compress the array. If users want to compress primitive array, users need to register custom
serializers for such types or mark it as list type.

Float array specifics:

- float16/bfloat16 array: write `varuint` length, then raw bytes in little endian order.
- float8 array: write element type kind as a byte, then `varuint` length, then raw bytes in little endian order.

#### Multi-dimensional arrays

Current xlang does not define a dedicated multi-dimensional array/tensor encoding. Multi-dimensional
arrays are serialized as nested lists, while one-dimensional primitive arrays use the `*_ARRAY`
type IDs. Internal type ID `ARRAY (42)` is reserved for a future dedicated multi-dimensional array
encoding and is not used in current xlang streams.

#### object array

Object array is serialized using the list format. Object component type will be taken as list element
generic type.

### map

Map uses a chunk-based format to handle heterogeneous key-value pairs efficiently:

```
| varuint32: total_size | chunk_1 | chunk_2 | ... | chunk_n |
```

#### Map Chunk Format

Each chunk contains up to 255 key-value pairs with the same metadata characteristics:

```
|    1 byte    |     1 byte     |        variable bytes        |
+--------------+----------------+------------------------------+
|  KV header   |  chunk size N  |  N key-value pairs (N*2 obj) |
```

#### KV Header Bits

The KV header is a single byte encoding metadata for both keys and values:

```
|  bit 7-6   |     bit 5     |     bit 4    |     bit 3     |     bit 2     |     bit 1    |     bit 0     |
+------------+---------------+--------------+---------------+---------------+--------------+---------------+
|  reserved  | val_decl_type | val_has_null | val_track_ref | key_decl_type | key_has_null | key_track_ref |
```

| Bit | Name          | Value | Meaning when SET (1)                     |
| --- | ------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0   | key_track_ref | 0x01  | Track references for keys                |
| 1   | key_has_null  | 0x02  | Keys may be null (rare, usually invalid) |
| 2   | key_decl_type | 0x04  | Key is the declared generic type         |
| 3   | val_track_ref | 0x08  | Track references for values              |
| 4   | val_has_null  | 0x10  | Values may be null                       |
| 5   | val_decl_type | 0x20  | Value is the declared generic type       |

**Common KV header values:**

| Header | Hex | Meaning                                                             |
| ------ | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x24   | 36  | Key + value are declared types, non-null, no ref tracking (optimal) |
| 0x2C   | 44  | Key + value declared types, value tracks refs                       |
| 0x34   | 52  | Key + value declared types, value may be null                       |
| 0x00   | 0   | Key + value not declared types, non-null, no ref tracking           |

#### Chunk Size

- Maximum chunk size: 255 pairs (fits in 1 byte)
- When key or value is null, that entry is serialized as a separate chunk with implicit size 1 (chunk size byte is skipped)
- Reader tracks accumulated count against total map size to know when to stop reading chunks

#### Why Chunk-Based Format?

Map iteration is expensive. Computing a single header for all pairs would require two passes. The chunk-based
approach allows:

1. **Optimistic prediction**: Use first key-value pair to predict header
2. **Adaptive chunking**: Start new chunk if prediction fails for a pair
3. **Efficient reading**: Most maps fit in single chunk (< 255 pairs)
4. **Memory efficiency**: Minimal overhead for common homogeneous maps

#### Why serialize chunk by chunk?

When fory will use first key-value pair to predict header optimistically, it can't know how many pairs have same
meta(tracking kef ref, key has null and so on). If we don't write chunk by chunk with max chunk size, we must write at
least `X` bytes to take up a place for later to update the number which has same elements, `X` is the num_bytes for
encoding varint encoding of map size.

And most map size are smaller than 255, if all pairs have same data, the chunk will be 1. This is common in golang/rust,
which object are not reference by default.

Also, if only one or two keys have different meta, we can make it into a different chunk, so that most pairs can share
meta.

The implementation can accumulate read count with map size to decide whether to read more chunks.

### enum

Enums are serialized as an unsigned varint enum ID.

- If the enum definition provides an explicit enum ID / variant ID / stable numeric tag for a
  value, that ID MUST be used.
- If no explicit enum ID is specified, the declaration ordinal is used as the enum ID by default.

This means the wire contract is always an enum ID. When the enum ID comes from declaration order,
reordering enum values changes the wire IDs and can change the deserialized result. For
cross-language or long-lived schemas, users should prefer explicit stable enum IDs.

### timestamp

Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any calendar/timezone. It is encoded as:

- `seconds` (int64): seconds since Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)
- `nanos` (uint32): nanosecond adjustment within the second

On write, implementations must normalize negative timestamps so that `nanos` is always in `[0, 1_000_000_000)`.
This is a fixed-size 12-byte payload (8 bytes seconds + 4 bytes nanos).

### date

Date represents a date without timezone. It is encoded as:

- `days` (varint64): signed count of days since the Unix epoch (`1970-01-01`)

The value is reconstructed as `LocalDate.ofEpochDay(days)` or the equivalent calendar-date constructor in
the target language implementation.

This `varint64` encoding applies to xlang serialization only. Native, language-specific local-date
encodings are unchanged.

### decimal

A decimal value is encoded as:

1. `scale`: signed varint32
2. `unscaledHeader`: unsigned varint64
3. optional `payload`: present only for large unscaled values

The mathematical value is:

`value = unscaled × 10^-scale`

#### Scale

- `scale` is encoded as signed varint32.
- `scale` carries no extra flags or mode bits.

#### Unscaled Header

`unscaledHeader` selects the encoding of `unscaled`:

- If `(unscaledHeader & 1) == 0`, the value uses the small encoding.
- If `(unscaledHeader & 1) == 1`, the value uses the big encoding.

#### Small Encoding

For small values, `unscaled` must fit in signed 64-bit range and the zigzag-encoded value must fit in 63 bits.

Encoding:

- `unscaledHeader = zigzag(unscaled) << 1`
- no payload is written

Decoding:

- `unscaled = zigzagDecode(unscaledHeader >>> 1)`

#### Big Encoding

For big values, `unscaled` is encoded as sign plus magnitude bytes.

Encoding:

- `sign = 0` if `unscaled >= 0`, otherwise `1`
- `magnitude = abs(unscaled)`
- `len = byte length of magnitude in canonical minimal little-endian form`
- `meta = (len << 1) | sign`
- `unscaledHeader = (meta << 1) | 1`
- `payload = magnitude as canonical minimal little-endian bytes`

Decoding:

- `meta = unscaledHeader >>> 1`
- `sign = meta & 1`
- `len = meta >>> 1`
- read `len` bytes as little-endian unsigned magnitude
- `unscaled = magnitude` if `sign == 0`, otherwise `-magnitude`

#### Canonical Rules

- Zero must use the small encoding.
- Big encoding must not be used for zero.
- In big encoding, `payload` must be the minimal little-endian representation.
- Therefore, for big encoding, `len > 0` and `payload[len - 1] != 0`.

#### Final Value

After decoding `scale` and `unscaled`, the decimal value is reconstructed as:

`value = unscaled × 10^-scale`

### struct

Struct means object of `class/pojo/struct/bean/record` type. Struct values are serialized by writing
fields in Fory order. The type meta before the value is written according to the rules in
[Type Meta](#type-meta).

#### Field order

Field order must be deterministic and identical across languages. This section defines the
language-neutral ordering algorithm; implementations must follow the rules here rather than any
language-specific helper classes.

##### Step 1: Field identifier

For every field, compute a stable identifier used for ordering:

- If a non-negative tag ID is configured (e.g., `@ForyField(id=...)`), use the tag ID.
- Otherwise, use the field name converted to `snake_case`.

Configured tag IDs must be non-negative. A negative configured tag ID is invalid; languages may
use a negative value only as a default or internal sentinel for "no tag ID configured", which falls
back to the `snake_case` field name and is not a tag ID. Tag IDs must be unique within a type;
duplicate tag IDs are invalid.

Field identifiers compare as follows:

1. If both fields have tag IDs, compare the IDs numerically.
2. If only one field has a tag ID, the tagged field sorts first.
3. If neither field has a tag ID, compare the `snake_case` names lexicographically.
4. If fields still compare equal, use deterministic language-local tie-breakers such as declaring
   class name, original field name, or original field index.

##### Step 2: Group assignment

Assign each field to exactly one group in the following order:

1. **Primitive (non-nullable)**: primitive or boxed numeric/boolean types without nullable metadata.
2. **Primitive (nullable)**: primitive or boxed numeric/boolean types with nullable metadata.
3. **Non-primitive**: every other field, including strings, time/date/duration/decimal/binary
   values, unions, primitive arrays, collections, maps, enums, structs, ext/user-defined types,
   UNKNOWN fields, object arrays, and all other non-primitive schemas.

##### Step 3: Intra-group ordering

Within each group, apply the following sort keys in order until a difference is found:

**Primitive groups (1 and 2):**

1. **Compression category**: fixed-size numeric and boolean types first, then compressed numeric
   types (`VARINT32`, `VAR_UINT32`, `VARINT64`, `VAR_UINT64`, `TAGGED_INT64`, `TAGGED_UINT64`).
2. **Primitive size** (descending): 8-byte > 4-byte > 2-byte > 1-byte.
3. **Internal type ID** (ascending) as a tie-breaker for equal sizes.
4. **Field identifier** using the comparator from Step 1.

**Non-primitive group (3):**

1. **Field identifier** using the comparator from Step 1.

If two fields still compare equal after the rules above, preserve a deterministic order by
comparing declaring class name and then the original field name. This tie-breaker should be
reachable only in invalid schemas (e.g., duplicate tag IDs).

##### Notes

- The ordering above is used for serialization order and TypeDef field lists. Schema hashes use
  the field identifier ordering described in the schema hash section.
- Non-primitive type IDs and codec categories must not affect field order. Implementations may keep
  internal categories to preserve optimized serializers and generated code paths, but the categories
  are not ordering keys.
- The compressed numeric rule is critical for cross-language consistency: compressed integer
  fields are always placed after all fixed-width integer fields.

#### Same-schema mode (meta share disabled)

Object value layout:

```
| [optional 4-byte schema hash] | field values |
```

The schema hash is written only when class-version checking is enabled. It is the low 32 bits of a
MurmurHash3 x64_128 of the struct fingerprint string:

- For each field, build `<field_id_or_name>,<field_type_fingerprint>;`.
- Field identifier is the tag ID if present, otherwise the snake_case field name.
- Sort by the field identifier comparator from [Field order](#field-order) before concatenation.
- `field_type_fingerprint` is recursive:
  - Leaf: `<type_id>,<ref>,<nullable>`
  - `LIST` / `SET`: `<type_id>,<ref>,<nullable>[<element_fingerprint>]`
  - `MAP`: `<type_id>,<ref>,<nullable>[<key_fingerprint>|<value_fingerprint>]`
- Nested container element/key/value fingerprints include nested type ID, container shape, and effective integer encoding, but nested `nullable` and `ref` policy are always hashed as `0`. Only the root field `nullable` and `ref` bits participate in schema hash, because nested reads honor the wire null/ref flags directly.
- This schema-hash rule is only for same-schema mode without TypeDef metadata. It
  does not permit compatible-mode matched-field classification to accept nested
  nullability or reference-tracking mismatches.

Field values are serialized in Fory order. Primitive fields are written as raw values (nullable
primitives include a null flag). Non-primitive fields write ref/null flags as needed and then the
value; polymorphic fields include type meta.

#### Compatible mode (meta share enabled)

The field value layout is the same as same-schema mode, but the type meta for
`COMPATIBLE_STRUCT` and `NAMED_COMPATIBLE_STRUCT` uses shared TypeDef entries. Deserializers use
TypeDef to map fields by name or tag ID and to honor nullable/ref flags from metadata; unknown fields
are skipped.

### Union

Union values are encoded using three union type IDs so the union schema identity lives in type meta (like
`STRUCT/ENUM/EXT`) and is easy to carry inside `Any`.

#### IDL syntax

```fdl
union Contact [id=0] {
  string email = 0;
  int32  phone = 1;
}
```

Rules:

- A union schema MUST declare at least one schema-defined alternative. The
  unknown-case carrier used by some language bindings is implementation-provided and is
  omitted from the schema's alternative table.
- Each union alternative MUST have a stable non-negative tag number (`= 0`, `= 1`, ...).
- Tag numbers MUST be unique within the union and MUST NOT be reused.
- Unknown-case carriers exposed by language bindings have no local schema tag of
  their own; they replay the original peer schema tag when reserialized.

#### Type IDs and type meta

| Type ID | Name        | Meaning                                              |
| ------: | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|      33 | UNION       | Union value, schema identity not embedded            |
|      34 | TYPED_UNION | Union value with registered numeric type ID          |
|      35 | NAMED_UNION | Union value with embedded type name / shared TypeDef |

Type meta encoding:

- `UNION (33)`: no additional type meta payload.
- `TYPED_UNION (34)`: write `user_type_id` as varuint32 after the type ID.
- `NAMED_UNION (35)`: followed by named type meta (namespace + type name, or shared TypeDef marker/body).

Field TypeDef metadata MUST use `UNION` for statically typed union fields,
including generated typed ADT union fields. It MUST NOT use `TYPED_UNION` or
`NAMED_UNION` there, because the field owner already supplies the union schema.

#### Union value payload

A union payload is:

```
| case_id (varuint32) | case_value (Any-style value) |
```

`case_id` is the union alternative tag number.
Runtime APIs MAY expose zero-based ordinal indexes for generic union carriers;
those ordinals are valid wire `case_id` values when they are the schema's
alternative IDs.

`case_value` MUST be encoded as a full xlang value:

```
| field_ref_meta | field_value_type_meta | field_value_bytes |
```

This is required even for primitives so unknown alternatives can be skipped safely.

If a reader sees a `case_id` that is not present in its local union
schema, it SHOULD preserve the unknown case when the target language has a
language-neutral carrier for it. Such a carrier MUST expose the original case
ID and decoded value, and it MUST retain only implementation-internal wire type ID
state needed for reserialization. It MUST NOT store resolver-owned type
metadata or other context-owned state. Writers MUST use the stored original
case ID for the union envelope, not any generated carrier marker. Unknown-case
payload writers MUST emit the Any-style payload body in wire order: ref
metadata first, then full value type metadata, then value bytes. For internal
numeric type IDs, the type ID byte is the complete value type metadata and the
payload writer MAY use the stored wire type ID to preserve fixed, variable, or
tagged integer encodings when the decoded value has the expected concrete value type.
These scalar numeric payloads are not reference-tracked, so their ref metadata
is `NotNullValue`. Otherwise it MUST fall back to the language implementation's
ordinary polymorphic Any-value writer. Unknown carriers are implementation-provided
forward-compatibility containers, not entries in the local schema case table;
schema-defined union cases MAY use `0..N`. When an unknown carrier is written
back, the union envelope MUST use the carrier's original peer schema case ID
unchanged, including `0` if that was the original peer schema case ID.

#### Wire layouts

**UNION (schema known from context)**

```
| ... outer ref meta ... | type_id=UNION(33) | case_id | case_value |
```

**TYPED_UNION (schema identified by numeric id)**

```
| ... outer ref meta ... | type_id=TYPED_UNION(34) | user_type_id | case_id | case_value |
```

user_type_id: varuint32 numeric registration ID for the union schema.

**NAMED_UNION (schema embedded by name/typedef)**

```
| ... outer ref meta ... | type_id=NAMED_UNION(35) | name_or_typedef | case_id | case_value |
```

#### Decoding rules

1. Read outer ref meta and `type_id`.
2. If `TYPED_UNION`, read `user_type_id` and resolve the union schema by ID.
3. If `NAMED_UNION`, read named type meta and resolve the union schema.
4. Read `case_id`.
5. Read `case_value` as Any-style value (ref meta + type meta + value).

If `case_id` is unknown, the decoder MUST still consume the case value using `field_value_type_meta` and
standard `skipValue(type_id)`.

#### When to use each type ID

- Use `UNION` when the union schema is known from context. This includes
  statically typed generated union fields: the owning field metadata supplies
  the union schema, so the field type ID remains `UNION` even if the root or
  dynamic value form would identify the union as `TYPED_UNION` or `NAMED_UNION`.
- Use `TYPED_UNION` for dynamic containers when numeric registration is available.
- Use `NAMED_UNION` when name-based resolution is preferred or required.

#### Compatibility notes

- `case_id` is a stable identifier; added alternatives are forward compatible and unknown cases can be skipped.

### Type

Type will be serialized using type meta format.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Byte Order**: Always use little-endian for multi-byte values
2. **Varint Sign Extension**: Ensure proper handling of signed vs unsigned varints
3. **Reference ID Ordering**: IDs must be assigned in serialization order
4. **Field Order Consistency**: Must match exactly across languages in same-schema mode; in compatible mode, match by TypeDef field names or tag IDs
5. **String Encoding**: Use best encoding for current language
6. **Null Handling**: Different languages represent null differently
7. **Empty Collections**: Still write length (0) and header byte
8. **Schema Hash Calculation**: Must use the same fingerprint and MurmurHash3 algorithm across languages when enabled
