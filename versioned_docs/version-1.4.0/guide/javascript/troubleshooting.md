This page covers common problems when using Fory JavaScript.

## Cannot deserialize a non-cross-language payload

Fory JavaScript only reads Fory cross-language payloads. If the producer is a Java or Go service using a native-mode format, the JavaScript side cannot decode it.

Fix: switch the producer to xlang payloads. Java and Go use xlang by default; use compatible mode
unless every peer uses the same schema.

## `maxDepth must be an integer >= 2`

This means you passed an invalid `maxDepth` value. It must be a positive integer of at least 2.

```ts
new Fory({ maxDepth: 100 });
```

Increase this only if your data is legitimately deeply nested.

## `Field "..." is not nullable`

You are passing `null` to a field that was not declared nullable. Fix: add `.setNullable(true)` to the field schema:

```ts
const userType = Type.struct("example.user", {
  name: Type.string(),
  email: Type.string().setNullable(true), // ← this field can be null
});
```

## Objects are not the same instance after deserialization

Fory does not preserve object identity by default. Two fields pointing to the same object will become two independent copies.

Fix: enable **both** of these:

1. `new Fory({ ref: true })` on the instance
2. `.setTrackingRef(true)` on the specific fields

See [References](references.md).

## Large integers come back as `bigint`

This is expected. Fory uses `bigint` for any 64-bit integer field (`Type.int64()`, `Type.uint64()`). If you need a `number`, use a smaller integer type like `Type.int32()` — but only if the value actually fits in 32 bits.

## Inspecting Generated Serializer Code

If you need to debug what Fory is doing under the hood, inspect the generated serializer code with a hook:

```ts
const fory = new Fory({
  hooks: {
    afterCodeGenerated(code) {
      console.log(code);
      return code;
    },
  },
});
```

## `@apache-fory/hps` Install Fails

`@apache-fory/hps` is an optional Node.js accelerator. If it fails to install (e.g. on a platform without native module support), just remove it from your dependencies. Fory still works correctly without it.
