This page covers advanced Java Fory features that are not part of first-use serialization.
Java native-mode zero-copy serialization is documented in [Native Serialization](native-serialization.md), and deep
copy semantics are documented in [Object Copy](object-copy.md).

## Memory Allocation Customization

Fory provides a `MemoryAllocator` interface that allows you to customize how memory buffers are allocated and grown during serialization operations. This can be useful for performance optimization, memory pooling, or debugging memory usage.

### MemoryAllocator Interface

The `MemoryAllocator` interface defines two key methods:

```java
public interface MemoryAllocator {
  /**
   * Allocates a new MemoryBuffer with the specified initial capacity.
   */
  MemoryBuffer allocate(int initialCapacity);

  /**
   * Grows an existing buffer to accommodate the new capacity.
   * The implementation must grow the buffer in-place by modifying
   * the existing buffer instance.
   */
  void grow(MemoryBuffer buffer, int newCapacity);
}
```

### Using Custom Memory Allocators

You can set a global memory allocator that will be used by all `MemoryBuffer` instances:

```java
// Create a custom allocator
MemoryAllocator customAllocator = new MemoryAllocator() {
  @Override
  public MemoryBuffer allocate(int initialCapacity) {
    // Add extra capacity for debugging or pooling
    return MemoryBuffer.fromByteArray(new byte[initialCapacity + 100]);
  }

  @Override
  public void grow(MemoryBuffer buffer, int newCapacity) {
    if (newCapacity <= buffer.size()) {
      return;
    }

    // Custom growth strategy - add 100% extra capacity
    int newSize = (int) (newCapacity * 2);
    byte[] data = new byte[newSize];
    buffer.get(0, data, 0, buffer.size());
    buffer.initHeapBuffer(data, 0, data.length);
  }
};

// Set the custom allocator globally
MemoryBuffer.setGlobalAllocator(customAllocator);

// All subsequent MemoryBuffer allocations will use your custom allocator
Fory fory = Fory.builder().withXlang(false).build();
byte[] bytes = fory.serialize(someObject); // Uses custom allocator
```

### Default Memory Allocator Behavior

The default allocator uses the following growth strategy:

- For buffers smaller than `BUFFER_GROW_STEP_THRESHOLD` (100MB): multiply capacity by 2
- For larger buffers: multiply capacity by 1.5 (capped at `Integer.MAX_VALUE - 8`)

This provides a balance between avoiding frequent reallocations and preventing excessive memory usage.

### Use Cases

Custom memory allocators are useful for:

- **Memory Pooling**: Reuse allocated buffers to reduce GC pressure
- **Performance Tuning**: Use different growth strategies based on your workload
- **Debugging**: Add logging or tracking to monitor memory usage
- **Off-heap Memory**: Integrate with off-heap memory management systems

## Logging

### ForyLogger

By default, Fory uses a custom logger `ForyLogger` for internal needs at `WARN` level, or `INFO` level when `ENABLE_FORY_DEBUG_OUTPUT=1` is set. Set `FORY_LOG_LEVEL` to `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, or `DEBUG` to configure the process default level before startup. `ForyLogger` builds resulting logged data into a single string and sends it directly to `System.out`. The result line layout is similar to (in Log4j notation):

```
%d{yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss} %p  %C:%L [%t] - %m%n
```

The layout can't be changed.

Example output:

```
2025-11-07 08:49:59 INFO  CompileUnit:55 [main] - Generate code for org.apache.fory.builder.SerializedLambdaForyCodec_0 took 35 ms.
2025-11-07 08:50:00 INFO  JaninoUtils:121 [main] - Compile [SerializedLambdaForyCodec_0] take 144 ms
```

### Slf4jLogger

If a more sophisticated logger is required, configure Fory to use Slf4j via `LoggerFactory.useSlf4jLogging()`. For example, enabling Slf4j before creating Fory:

```java
public static final ThreadSafeFory FORY;

static {
  LoggerFactory.useSlf4jLogging(true);
  FORY = Fory.builder().withXlang(false)
    .buildThreadSafeFory();
}
```

**Note:** Enabling Slf4j via `useSlf4jLogging` will be ignored when the application runs in a GraalVM native image.

### Suppress Fory Logs

Both `ForyLogger` and `Slf4jLogger` allow controlling log output level or suppressing logs entirely. Configure logger level via `LoggerFactory.setLogLevel()`:

```java
static {
  // to log only WARN and higher
  LoggerFactory.setLogLevel(LogLevel.WARN_LEVEL);

  // to disable logging entirely
  LoggerFactory.disableLogging();
}
```

**Note:** Selected logging level is applied before Slf4j implementation's logger level. So if you set `WARN_LEVEL` (as in the example above) then you will not see INFO messages from Fory even if INFO is enabled in Logback.
