This page lists the Dart types you can use in Fory messages, and flags where you need to be careful for cross-language compatibility.

## Built-in Primitive Types

The following Dart types serialize directly without any special handling:

| Dart type            | Cross-language notes                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bool`               | Direct mapping                                                                                                                                                 |
| `int`                | Serialized as 64-bit by default. Use `@ForyField(type: Int8Type/Int16Type/Int32Type/Uint8Type/Uint16Type/Uint32Type)` when the peer expects a narrower integer |
| `double`             | Maps to 64-bit float. Use `Float32` wrapper when the peer expects 32-bit                                                                                       |
| `String`             | Direct mapping                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Uint8List`          | Binary blob                                                                                                                                                    |
| `List`, `Set`, `Map` | Supported; element types must also be supported                                                                                                                |
| `DateTime`           | Use `Timestamp` or `LocalDate` wrappers for explicit semantics                                                                                                 |

## Integer Fields

Dart VM/native `int` can represent signed 64-bit values, while Dart web `int`
is limited to JavaScript-safe integer precision. If the peer language expects a
32-bit integer (Java `int`, Go `int32`, C# `int`) and you send a Dart `int`,
the deserialization may fail or silently truncate. For browser and Flutter web
precision rules, see [Web Platform Support](web-platform-support.md).

Use field metadata to select the wire type explicitly for 8/16/32-bit fields:

```dart
@ForyStruct()
class Metrics {
  Metrics();

  @ForyField(type: Int8Type())
  int tiny = 0;

  @ForyField(type: Int32Type(encoding: Encoding.fixed))
  int age = 0;

  @ForyField(type: Uint32Type())
  int count = 0;

  Int64 sequence = Int64(0);
  Uint64 offset = Uint64(0);
}
```

Generated serializers range-check annotated `int` values before writing them.
Use `Int64` and `Uint64` when you need full-range 64-bit values, especially on
web. A plain root `int` value serializes as xlang `int64`; exact 8/16/32-bit
wire widths are selected through field metadata or low-level `Buffer` APIs.

On Dart VM, `Int64` and `Uint64` are extension types over `int`. Once a value is
passed through an `Object`-typed dynamic/root boundary, the VM cannot recover
whether it was originally a plain `int`, `Int64`, or `Uint64`. Use generated
field metadata or explicit `Buffer` APIs when native VM payloads must preserve
unsigned 64-bit identity across dynamic boundaries. Dart web uses wrapper
classes, so web root `Uint64` values keep `varuint64` metadata.

## Floating-Point Types

Dart `double` maps to 64-bit float by default. If the peer uses
reduced-precision floating-point values, keep the Dart field as `double` and
mark the exact wire type with field metadata:

- `Float32` — 32-bit float (matches Java `float`, C# `float`, Go `float32`)
- `@ForyField(type: Float16Type()) double value` — half-precision scalar
- `@ForyField(type: Bfloat16Type()) double value` — bfloat16 scalar

For contiguous 16-bit floating-point arrays, use `Float16List` and
`Bfloat16List` rather than `Uint16List` when the schema is `array<float16>`
or `array<bfloat16>`.

## Time and Date Types

Avoid sending raw `DateTime` across languages — time zone handling and epoch differences vary. Use the explicit wrappers instead:

- `Timestamp` — a UTC instant with nanosecond precision (seconds + nanoseconds)
- `LocalDate` — a calendar date without time or time zone
- `Duration` — an elapsed time value using Dart's built-in `Duration`

```dart
final now = Timestamp.fromDateTime(DateTime.now().toUtc());
final birthday = LocalDate(1990, 12, 1);
final timeout = const Duration(seconds: 30);
```

The temporal wrappers expose conversion helpers:

- `Timestamp.fromDateTime(...)` and `timestamp.toDateTime()`
- `LocalDate.fromEpochDay(Int64(...))`, `date.toEpochDay()` returns `Int64`
- `LocalDate.fromDateTime(...)` and `date.toDateTime()`

`Duration` support in Dart is exact to microseconds. Incoming xlang duration
payloads that use sub-microsecond nanoseconds are rejected instead of being
silently truncated.

## Structs and Enums

Annotate classes with `@ForyStruct()` and run `build_runner` to make them serializable. Enums in the same file are included automatically.

```dart
@ForyStruct()
class User {
  User();

  String name = '';

  @ForyField(type: Int32Type())
  int age = 0; // use explicit field metadata when peers expect a 32-bit integer
}
```

See [Code Generation](code-generation.md).

## Collections

Fory supports `List<T>`, `Set<T>`, and `Map<K, V>`. Element and key types must
also be serializable types. Avoid using mutable objects as map keys.

Generic `List<int>` with primitive element metadata still uses `list<T>` schema.
Dedicated dense array schema comes from dedicated carriers:

- `BoolList` plus `@ArrayField(element: BoolType())` for `array<bool>`.
  Plain `List<bool>` maps to `list<bool>`.
- `Int8List`, `Int16List`, `Int32List`, `Int64List`
- `Uint8List`, `Uint16List`, `Uint32List`, `Uint64List`
- `Float16List`, `Bfloat16List`, `Float32List`, `Float64List`

## Compatibility Tip

When in doubt about whether a Dart type will match what the peer expects, make
the width explicit with `@ForyField(type: ...)`. Guessing the wrong numeric
width is one of the most common cross-language bugs.
