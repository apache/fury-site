A custom serializer lets you control exactly how a type is encoded and decoded. You only need one when:

- the type comes from a package you cannot modify and cannot be annotated with `@ForyStruct()`
- you need a completely custom binary layout
- you are implementing a union/discriminated type

For your own models, `@ForyStruct()` with code generation is almost always the better choice.

## Implement `Serializer<T>`

Subclass `Serializer<T>` and implement `write` and `read`. Use `context.buffer` to read and write raw bytes:

```dart
import 'package:fory/fory.dart';

final class Person {
  Person(this.name, this.age);

  final String name;
  final int age;
}

final class PersonSerializer extends Serializer<Person> {
  const PersonSerializer();

  @override
  void write(WriteContext context, Person value) {
    final buffer = context.buffer;
    buffer.writeUtf8(value.name);
    buffer.writeInt64FromInt(value.age);
  }

  @override
  Person read(ReadContext context) {
    final buffer = context.buffer;
    return Person(buffer.readUtf8(), buffer.readInt64AsInt());
  }
}
```

Register the serializer before you use it:

```dart
final fory = Fory();
fory.registerSerializer(
  Person,
  const PersonSerializer(),
  name: 'example.Person',
);
```

## Writing Nested Objects

When your serializer has a field that is itself a Fory-managed type, use `context.writeRef` and `context.readRef` rather than calling `fory.serialize` recursively. This keeps reference tracking correct and avoids writing a full root frame inside a nested payload.

```dart
@override
void write(WriteContext context, Wrapper value) {
  context.writeRef(value.child);
}

@override
Wrapper read(ReadContext context) {
  return Wrapper(context.readRef() as Child);
}
```

If you do not need reference identity tracking for a nested value (i.e., you know the value will never appear more than once in a graph), use `writeNonRef`:

```dart
context.writeNonRef(value.child);
```

## Unions

For a discriminated/tagged union, extend `UnionSerializer<T>` instead of `Serializer<T>`. Write a discriminant value first, then the active variant; read the discriminant and dispatch accordingly.

```dart
final class ShapeSerializer extends UnionSerializer<Shape> {
  const ShapeSerializer();

  @override
  void write(WriteContext context, Shape value) {
    // write active variant
  }

  @override
  Shape read(ReadContext context) {
    // read discriminant, return correct variant
    throw UnimplementedError();
  }
}
```

## Circular References in Custom Serializers

If your serializer can encounter circular object graphs, bind the object to the reference tracker **before** reading its nested fields:

```dart
final value = Node.empty();
context.reference(value);         // register the object first
value.next = context.readRef() as Node?;  // now nested reads can refer back to it
return value;
```

Skipping this step causes back-references to that object to resolve to `null`.

## Tips

- Use `context.buffer` for direct byte reads/writes in hot paths.
- Register the serializer with the same identity (`id` or `name`) on every side.
