Fory Dart supports Dart VM/AOT, Flutter, browser, and Flutter web builds
through generated serializers and platform-specific implementations.
The public API and registration flow are the same across these platforms, but
web builds have stricter integer precision rules because Dart `int` is
represented by JavaScript numbers.

## Supported Targets

Fory Dart supports:

- Dart VM/JIT applications.
- Dart AOT/native applications.
- Flutter mobile and desktop applications.
- Dart applications compiled to JavaScript for browsers.
- Flutter web applications.
- Generated `@ForyStruct` serializers and manually registered serializers on
  all supported targets.

## Code Generation Is Required

Fory Dart uses explicit registration instead of runtime reflection. For
annotated structs, run code generation and register the generated serializer
before serializing or deserializing values:

```dart
import 'package:fory/fory.dart';

part 'account.fory.dart';

@ForyStruct()
class Account {
  Account();

  String name = '';
  Int64 sequence = Int64(0);
}

void main() {
  final fory = Fory();
  AccountForyModule.register(
    fory,
    Account,
    name: 'example.Account',
  );

  final bytes = fory.serialize(Account()..name = 'web');
  final account = fory.deserialize<Account>(bytes);
  print(account.name);
}
```

Generate the companion file before building or testing:

```bash
cd dart/packages/fory
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

The registration call is the same on VM/AOT, Flutter, and web. Manual
serializers use `registerSerializer(...)`; generated structs use the generated
`register` wrapper.

## 64-Bit Integer Rules

Dart VM `int` values are signed 64-bit values. Dart web `int` values are backed
by JavaScript numbers and are precise only in the JS-safe integer range:

```text
-9007199254740991 <= value <= 9007199254740991
```

Use this rule when choosing field types:

| Logical value                            | Recommended Dart field type on web | Notes                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Signed 64-bit value within JS-safe range | `int`                              | Works with default `int64` mapping and `@ForyField(type: Int64Type(...))` encodings. |
| Full signed 64-bit range                 | `Int64`                            | Preserves values outside the JS-safe range.                                          |
| Unsigned 64-bit value                    | `Uint64`                           | Required for values that do not fit in signed or JS-safe Dart `int`.                 |
| 8/16/32-bit integer                      | `int` + `@ForyField(type: ...)`    | Use explicit field metadata to match peer languages exactly.                         |

`@ForyField(type: Int64Type(...))` controls the wire encoding of a Dart `int`
field:

```dart
@ForyStruct()
class SafeCounter {
  SafeCounter();

  @ForyField(type: Int64Type(encoding: Encoding.tagged))
  int count = 0; // keep web values inside the JS-safe range
}
```

It does not make Dart `int` capable of storing every 64-bit value on web. For
full-range signed values, use `Int64`:

```dart
@ForyStruct()
class FullRangeCounter {
  FullRangeCounter();

  Int64 count = Int64(0);
}
```

For unsigned values, use `Uint64`:

```dart
@ForyStruct()
class StorageExtent {
  StorageExtent();

  Uint64 byteOffset = Uint64(0);
}
```

## Custom Serializers

Custom serializers can use the same `Buffer`, `WriteContext`, and `ReadContext`
APIs on VM/AOT, Flutter, and web. For 64-bit values:

- Use `buffer.writeInt64(Int64(...))` and `buffer.readInt64()` for full-range
  signed 64-bit values.
- Use `buffer.writeUint64(Uint64(...))` and `buffer.readUint64()` for full-range
  unsigned 64-bit values.
- Use `writeInt64FromInt`, `writeVarInt64FromInt`, and matching `AsInt` reads
  only when the value is intended to be a Dart `int` and therefore must stay
  JS-safe on web.

Example:

```dart
final class OffsetSerializer extends Serializer<StorageExtent> {
  const OffsetSerializer();

  @override
  void write(WriteContext context, StorageExtent value) {
    context.buffer.writeUint64(value.byteOffset);
  }

  @override
  StorageExtent read(ReadContext context) {
    return StorageExtent()..byteOffset = context.buffer.readUint64();
  }
}
```

## Collections And Typed Arrays

`List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Uint8List`, numeric typed arrays, `Int64List`, and
`Uint64List` are supported on web. The `Int64List` and `Uint64List`
implementations preserve 64-bit values without depending on JavaScript integer
precision. Use the Fory wrapper list types when the schema is `array<int64>`
or `array<uint64>`.

## Testing Browser Builds

Run the package tests in both VM and Chrome when changing code that must work on
web:

```bash
cd dart/packages/fory
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
dart test
dart test -p chrome
```

If Chrome tests fail with a stale generated file or missing part file, rerun
`build_runner` and then retry the test command from `dart/packages/fory`.

## Common Web Failures

### `Dart int value ... is outside the JS-safe signed int64 range`

The serializer is trying to write a Dart `int` as a signed 64-bit value on web,
but the value is outside the range that JavaScript numbers can represent
exactly. Change the field type to `Int64`, or keep the value inside the JS-safe
range.

### `Int64 value ... is not a JS-safe int`

The deserializer read a full-range `Int64`, but the target field or custom
serializer asked for a Dart `int`. Change the field type to `Int64`, or decode
with `readInt64()` instead of an `AsInt` helper.

### `Uint64 value ... is not a JS-safe int`

The code is converting a `Uint64` to Dart `int` on web. Keep the value as
`Uint64` unless the application has already validated that it is in the
JS-safe non-negative range.
