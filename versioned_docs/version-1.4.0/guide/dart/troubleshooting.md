This page covers common Dart issues and fixes.

## `Only xlang payloads are supported by the Dart implementation.`

The writer is sending a native-mode payload. Make sure every peer writes the xlang wire format:

- **Java**: configure the peer for xlang mode instead of native mode.
- **Go**: configure the peer for xlang mode.
- **Other languages**: check their respective guides for xlang mode.

## `Type ... is not registered.`

Fory does not know how to serialize or deserialize this type. Fix it by:

1. Running code generation if you haven't: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
2. Calling the generated `register` function (or `registerSerializer`) for the type **before** calling `serialize` or `deserialize`.
3. Registering **all** types that appear in a message, not just the root type. For example, if `Order` contains an `Address`, register both.

## Generated part file is missing or stale

Regenerate code:

```bash
cd dart/packages/fory
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

If you moved files or renamed types, rebuild before re-running analysis or tests.

## `Deserialized value has type ..., expected ...`

The payload describes a different type than `T` in `deserialize<T>`. Common causes:

- You registered the type on the writing side with a different ID or name than on the reading side.
- The payload was produced by a different code path that serializes a different root object.
- You are trying to deserialize a heterogeneous container — decode it as `Object?` or `List<Object?>` first, then cast.

## Objects aren't the same instance after deserialization

Fory does not track object identity by default, so two fields pointing to the same object will produce two independent copies after a round trip.

To preserve identity:

- For fields inside a `@ForyStruct`, add `@ForyField(ref: true)` to those fields.
- For a top-level collection, pass `trackRef: true` to `fory.serialize(...)`.
- In a custom serializer, use `context.writeRef` / `context.readRef` and call `context.reference(obj)` before reading nested fields.

## Cross-language field mismatch (missing data or wrong values)

Symptoms: fields come back as default values or wrong types after a round trip to another language.

Checklist:

1. Same registration identity on both sides (same numeric ID **or** same `name`).
2. Stable `@ForyField(id: ...)` assigned before the first payload was produced.
3. Compatible numeric widths — use `@ForyField(type: Int32Type())` in Dart when the peer field is `int` (Java), `int32` (Go), or `int` (C#).
4. `Timestamp` / `LocalDate` instead of raw `DateTime` for date/time fields.
5. Compatible schema evolution on both sides. Dart enables it by default; make sure peers have not explicitly selected `compatible: false`.

## Int64 or Uint64 values fail on web

On Dart VM builds, Dart `int` can represent signed 64-bit values. On Dart web
builds, Dart `int` values are backed by JavaScript numbers and are only precise
inside the JS-safe integer range:

```text
-9007199254740991 <= value <= 9007199254740991
```

If a generated serializer writes an `int64` field declared as Dart `int`,
web builds reject values outside that range instead of silently writing
corrupted bytes. To exchange full signed 64-bit values on web, declare the
field as Fory's `Int64` wrapper:

```dart
@ForyStruct()
class LedgerEntry {
  LedgerEntry();

  Int64 sequence = Int64(0); // full signed 64-bit range on VM and web
}
```

For unsigned 64-bit values, prefer `Uint64` rather than Dart `int`. Dart `int`
cannot represent the full `uint64` range on either VM or web:

```dart
@ForyStruct()
class FileBlock {
  FileBlock();

  Uint64 offset = Uint64(0); // full unsigned 64-bit range
}
```

`@ForyField(type: Int64Type(...))` changes the wire encoding for a Dart `int`
field, but it does not remove the web integer precision limit. Use `Int64` for
full-range signed values and `Uint64` for full-range unsigned values. See
[Web Platform Support](web-platform-support.md) for the full browser support
matrix and platform guidance.

## Running Tests Locally

Main Dart package:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
dart analyze
dart test
```

Integration test package:

```bash
cd dart/packages/fory-test
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
dart test
```

## Generated gRPC files cannot find `package:grpc` types

**Cause**: gRPC packages are application dependencies. The `fory` package does
not add gRPC as a hard dependency.

**Fix**: Add `grpc` to your `pubspec.yaml` (and the `build_runner` dev
dependency), then run `dart pub get`. See [gRPC Support](grpc-support.md).

## A protobuf client cannot decode a Fory gRPC service

**Cause**: Fory gRPC companions use gRPC transports with Fory-encoded message
bodies, not protobuf wire encoding.

**Fix**: Use a Fory-generated client for Fory-generated services, or expose a
separate protobuf service endpoint for generic protobuf clients.
