Apache Fory Swift provides high-performance object graph serialization with strong type safety, macro-based code generation, schema evolution, and cross-language compatibility.

## Why Fory Swift?

- Fast binary serialization for Swift value and reference types
- `@ForyStruct`, `@ForyEnum`, and `@ForyUnion` macros for zero-boilerplate model serialization
- Xlang protocol compatibility with Java, Rust, Go, Python, and more
- Compatible mode for schema evolution across versions
- Built-in support for dynamic values (`Any`, `AnyObject`, `any Serializer`, `AnyHashable`)
- Reference tracking for shared/circular graphs, including weak references on classes

## Install

Add Fory Swift from the Apache Fory GitHub repository:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apache/fory.git", exact: "$version")
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "MyApp",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "Fory", package: "fory")
        ]
    )
]
```

## Quick Example

```swift
import Fory

@ForyStruct
struct User: Equatable {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int32 = 0
}

let fory = Fory()
fory.register(User.self, id: 1)

let input = User(name: "alice", age: 30)
let data = try fory.serialize(input)
let output: User = try fory.deserialize(data)

assert(input == output)
```
