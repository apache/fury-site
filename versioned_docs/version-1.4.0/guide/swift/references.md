Swift reference tracking is controlled by `Config.trackRef`.

## Enable Reference Tracking

```swift
let fory = Fory(ref: true)
```

When enabled, reference-trackable types preserve identity and cycles.

## Shared Reference Example

```swift
import Fory

@ForyStruct
final class Animal {
    var name: String = ""

    required init() {}

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

@ForyStruct
final class AnimalPair {
    var first: Animal? = nil
    var second: Animal? = nil

    required init() {}

    init(first: Animal? = nil, second: Animal? = nil) {
        self.first = first
        self.second = second
    }
}

let fory = Fory(ref: true)
fory.register(Animal.self, id: 200)
fory.register(AnimalPair.self, id: 201)

let shared = Animal(name: "cat")
let input = AnimalPair(first: shared, second: shared)

let data = try fory.serialize(input)
let decoded: AnimalPair = try fory.deserialize(data)

assert(decoded.first === decoded.second)
```

## Circular Reference Example (Use `weak`)

`trackRef` preserves the reference graph, but it does not change ARC ownership.
Use `weak` on at least one edge in a cycle to avoid leaks.

```swift
import Fory

@ForyStruct
final class Node {
    var value: Int32 = 0
    weak var next: Node? = nil

    required init() {}

    init(value: Int32, next: Node? = nil) {
        self.value = value
        self.next = next
    }
}

let fory = Fory(ref: true)
fory.register(Node.self, id: 300)

let node = Node(value: 7)
node.next = node

let data = try fory.serialize(node)
let decoded: Node = try fory.deserialize(data)

assert(decoded.next === decoded)
```

## Notes

- Value types (`struct`, primitive values) do not carry identity semantics
- `trackRef` controls serialization graph identity, not ARC memory ownership
- Use `trackRef=false` for purely value-based payloads to reduce overhead
