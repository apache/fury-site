For types that cannot or should not use Fory model macros, implement `Serializer` manually.

## When to Use Custom Serializers

- External types with strict wire compatibility requirements
- Specialized compact encodings
- Existing payload adaptation paths
- Highly tuned hot-path serialization

## Implementing `Serializer`

```swift
import Foundation
import Fory

struct UUIDBox: Serializer, Equatable {
    var value: UUID = UUID(uuidString: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")!

    static func foryDefault() -> UUIDBox {
        UUIDBox()
    }

    static var staticTypeId: ForyTypeId {
        .ext
    }

    func foryWriteData(_ context: WriteContext, hasGenerics: Bool) throws {
        _ = hasGenerics
        try value.uuidString.foryWriteData(context, hasGenerics: false)
    }

    static func foryReadData(_ context: ReadContext) throws -> UUIDBox {
        let raw = try String.foryReadData(context)
        guard let uuid = UUID(uuidString: raw) else {
            throw ForyError.invalidData("invalid UUID string: \(raw)")
        }
        return UUIDBox(value: uuid)
    }
}
```

## Register and Use

```swift
let fory = Fory()
fory.register(UUIDBox.self, id: 300)

let input = UUIDBox(value: UUID())
let data = try fory.serialize(input)
let output: UUIDBox = try fory.deserialize(data)

assert(input == output)
```

## Choosing `staticTypeId`

For manually implemented custom types, use `staticTypeId` that matches the wire kind you are implementing.

Typical choices:

- `.structType`: regular structured object
- `.enumType` / `.typedUnion`: enum-like values
- `.ext`: extension/custom kind
