This page covers `Config` and recommended Fory presets.

## Config

`Fory` is configured with:

```swift
public struct Config {
  public let trackRef: Bool
  public let compatible: Bool
  public let checkClassVersion: Bool
  public let maxDepth: Int
  public let maxGraphMemoryBytes: Int64
  public let maxTypeFields: Int
  public let maxTypeMetaBytes: Int
  public let maxSchemaVersionsPerType: Int
  public let maxAverageSchemaVersionsPerType: Int
}
```

Default configuration:

```swift
let fory = Fory() // ref=false, compatible=true
```

Swift supports the xlang wire format only, so there is no `xlang` option in
`Config` or the `Fory` initializer.

## Threading

`Fory` is single-threaded and optimized to reuse one read/write context pair on the calling thread.
Reuse one instance per thread and do not use the same instance concurrently.

## Options

### `trackRef`

Enables shared/circular reference tracking for reference-trackable types.

- `false`: No reference table (smaller/faster for acyclic or value-only graphs)
- `true`: Preserve object identity for class/reference graphs

```swift
let fory = Fory(ref: true)
```

### `compatible`

Enables compatible schema mode for evolution across versions.

- `false`: Faster serialization and smaller size
- `true`: Compatible mode (supports add/remove/reorder fields)

Use `compatible: false` only when every reader and writer always uses the same schema and you want faster serialization and smaller size. For cross-language payloads, set `compatible: false` only after verifying that every language uses the same schema, or when native types are generated from Fory schema IDL.

```swift
let fory = Fory(compatible: false)
```

### `checkClassVersion`

Controls class-version validation when compatible mode is disabled. When
omitted, it defaults to `true` when `compatible: false` and `false` when
`compatible: true`.

```swift
let fory = Fory(compatible: false, checkClassVersion: true)
```

### Size and Depth Limits

`maxDepth` bounds decoded payload nesting depth.

`maxGraphMemoryBytes` sets an approximate graph-memory gate for one root deserialization. The
estimate mainly covers materialized arrays, dictionaries, sets, structs, classes, and objects. It
skips leaf values such as strings, binary data, primitive scalars, and dense primitive arrays, so
actual process memory can be higher than this value. Leaf values remain protected by
byte-availability checks: if the unread input does not contain enough bytes, Fory will not read or
create that leaf value. The default limit is a fixed `128 MiB` for all root input forms. A positive
value overrides the default. Explicit non-positive values are rejected when the runtime is created.

Compatible-mode remote metadata is also limited:

- `maxTypeFields` defaults to `512` and limits fields in one received struct metadata body.
- `maxTypeMetaBytes` defaults to `4096` and limits encoded body bytes in one received TypeMeta body,
  excluding the 8-byte header and any extended-size varint.
- `maxSchemaVersionsPerType` defaults to `10` and limits accepted remote metadata versions for one
  logical type.
- `maxAverageSchemaVersionsPerType` defaults to `3` and limits the average across accepted remote
  types. The effective global floor is `8192` schemas.

```swift
let fory = Fory(
  maxDepth: 5,
  maxGraphMemoryBytes: 128 * 1024 * 1024,
  maxTypeFields: 512,
  maxTypeMetaBytes: 4096,
  maxSchemaVersionsPerType: 10,
  maxAverageSchemaVersionsPerType: 3
)
```

## Recommended Presets

### Default service payloads

```swift
let fory = Fory()
```

### Graph/object identity workloads

```swift
let fory = Fory(ref: true)
```

### Same-schema optimization

Use this only when every reader and writer always uses the same schema.

```swift
let fory = Fory(compatible: false)
```

## Security

Security-related configuration:

- Register only the expected generated models before deserializing untrusted payloads.
- Use `checkClassVersion` with `compatible: false` for intentional same-schema payloads.
- Set `maxDepth` for the largest nesting depth your service accepts.
- Set `maxGraphMemoryBytes` as an approximate gate for collection, map, array, struct, class, and
  object-heavy payloads. It is not an exact heap cap; leaf values are gated by remaining input
  bytes.
- Keep the remote schema metadata limits at their defaults unless the data is not malicious and a
  trusted peer sends larger metadata or many schema versions.
