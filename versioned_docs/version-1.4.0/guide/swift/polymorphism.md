Fory Swift supports dynamic serialization for `Any`, `AnyObject`, and `any Serializer`.

## Top-level Dynamic APIs

```swift
let fory = Fory()

let dynamic: Any = Int32(7)
let data = try fory.serialize(dynamic)
let decoded: Any = try fory.deserialize(data)
```

Equivalent overloads exist for:

- `AnyObject`
- `any Serializer`
- `AnyHashable`
- `[Any]`
- `[String: Any]`
- `[Int32: Any]`
- `[AnyHashable: Any]`

## Dynamic Fields in Fory Model Types

```swift
@ForyStruct
struct DynamicHolder {
    var value: Any = ForyAnyNullValue()
    var list: [Any] = []
    var byName: [String: Any] = [:]
    var byId: [Int32: Any] = [:]
    var byDynamicKey: [AnyHashable: Any] = [:]
}
```

## Concrete Type Registration Still Applies

If dynamic values contain user-defined types, register those concrete types.

```swift
@ForyStruct
struct Address {
    var street: String = ""
    var zip: Int32 = 0
}

let fory = Fory()
fory.register(Address.self, id: 100)
```

## Null Semantics

- `Any` null representation: `ForyAnyNullValue`
- `AnyObject` null representation: `NSNull`
- Optional dynamic values map to the corresponding null representation on decode

## Current Limitations

- `AnyHashable` keys must wrap values that are both `Hashable` and supported by Fory dynamic serialization
