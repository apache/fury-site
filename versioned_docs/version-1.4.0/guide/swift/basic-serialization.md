This page covers object graph serialization and core API usage in Swift.

## Object Graph Serialization

Use `@ForyStruct`, `@ForyEnum`, or `@ForyUnion`, register types, then serialize and deserialize.

```swift
import Foundation
import Fory

@ForyStruct
struct Address: Equatable {
    var street: String = ""
    var zip: Int32 = 0
}

@ForyStruct
struct Person: Equatable {
    var id: Int64 = 0
    var name: String = ""
    var nickname: String? = nil
    var tags: Set<String> = []
    var scores: [Int32] = []
    var addresses: [Address] = []
    var metadata: [Int8: Int32?] = [:]
}

let fory = Fory()
fory.register(Address.self, id: 100)
fory.register(Person.self, id: 101)

let person = Person(
    id: 42,
    name: "Alice",
    nickname: nil,
    tags: ["swift", "xlang"],
    scores: [10, 20, 30],
    addresses: [Address(street: "Main", zip: 94107)],
    metadata: [1: 100, 2: nil]
)

let data = try fory.serialize(person)
let decoded: Person = try fory.deserialize(data)
assert(decoded == person)
```

## Working with Existing Buffers

Append serialized bytes to an existing `Data` and deserialize from `ByteBuffer`.

```swift
var output = Data()
try fory.serialize(person, to: &output)

let inputBuffer = ByteBuffer(data: output)
let fromBuffer: Person = try fory.deserialize(from: inputBuffer)
assert(fromBuffer == person)
```

## Built-in Supported Types

### Primitive and scalar

- `Bool`
- `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `Int`
- `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, `UInt64`, `UInt`
- `Float`, `Double`
- `String`
- `Data`

### Date and time

- `Date`
- `LocalDate`
- `Duration`

Use `Date` for timestamp values and `LocalDate` for day-only dates. `LocalDate`
supports epoch-day and `Date` conversions through `fromEpochDay(_:)`,
`toEpochDay()`, `init(utcDate:)`, and `toUTCDate()`.

### Collections

- `[T]` where `T: Serializer`
- `Set<T>` where `T: Serializer & Hashable`
- `[K: V]` where `K: Serializer & Hashable`, `V: Serializer`
- Optional variants (`T?`)

### Dynamic

- `Any`
- `AnyObject`
- `any Serializer`
- `AnyHashable`
- `[Any]`
- `[String: Any]`
- `[Int32: Any]`
- `[AnyHashable: Any]`
