This page covers C++ Fory instance configuration. `Fory::builder()` creates xlang
payloads by default. Compatible mode is also enabled by default. Select native
mode only when the payload stays in C++.

## Builder Pattern

Use `Fory::builder()` to construct Fory instances with custom configuration:

```cpp
#include "fory/serialization/fory.h"

using namespace fory::serialization;

// Default xlang mode.
auto fory = Fory::builder().build();

// Native mode for C++-only payloads.
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .xlang(false)
    .build();

// Same-schema optimization. Use only when every reader and writer
// always uses the same schema.
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .compatible(false)
    .build();
```

## Configuration

### xlang(bool)

Select the wire mode.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .xlang(false)
    .build();
```

When `true`, C++ writes the xlang wire format used by Java, Python, Go, Rust,
JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Swift, Dart, Scala, and Kotlin. When `false`, C++
writes native-mode payloads for C++-only traffic.

**Default:** `true`

### compatible(bool)

Compatible mode is enabled by default. No builder call is required for the
default compatible mode. Set `.compatible(false)` only when every reader and
writer always uses the same schema and you want faster serialization and smaller
size.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .compatible(false)
    .build();
```

For xlang payloads, use `.compatible(false)` only after verifying that every language uses the same schema, or when native types are generated from Fory schema IDL.

**Default:** `true`

### track_ref(bool)

Enable/disable reference tracking for shared and circular references.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .track_ref(true)  // Enable reference tracking
    .build();
```

When enabled, avoids duplicating shared objects and handles cycles.

**Default:** `true`

### max_graph_memory_bytes(int64_t)

Set an approximate graph-memory gate for one root deserialization.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .max_graph_memory_bytes(64 * 1024 * 1024)
    .build();
```

The default limit is a fixed `128 MiB` for byte-array, `Buffer`, and stream
roots. Positive values override the default. Explicit non-positive values are
rejected when the runtime is created.

This budget is an approximate lower-bound estimate for materialized graph
owners, mainly collections, maps, arrays, structs, and objects. It is not an
exact process heap limit; actual process memory can be higher. Dedicated
string, binary, primitive scalar, and primitive dense-array leaf values are
skipped by this budget and continue to rely on byte-availability checks: if the
unread input does not contain enough bytes, Fory will not read or create that
leaf value.

**Default:** `128 MiB`

### max_dyn_depth(uint32_t)

Set maximum allowed nesting depth for dynamically-typed objects.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .max_dyn_depth(10)  // Allow up to 10 levels
    .build();
```

This limits the maximum depth for nested polymorphic object serialization (e.g., `shared_ptr<Base>`, `unique_ptr<Base>`). This prevents stack overflow from deeply nested structures in dynamic serialization scenarios.

**Default:** `5`

**When to adjust:**

- **Increase**: For legitimate deeply nested data structures
- **Decrease**: For stricter security requirements or shallow data structures

### max_schema_versions_per_type(uint32_t)

Set the maximum accepted remote metadata versions for one logical type.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .max_schema_versions_per_type(10)
    .build();
```

**Default:** `10`

### max_type_fields(uint32_t)

Set the maximum fields accepted in one received remote struct metadata body.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .max_type_fields(512)
    .build();
```

**Default:** `512`

### max_type_meta_bytes(uint32_t)

Set the maximum encoded body bytes accepted for one received TypeDef body,
excluding the 8-byte header and any extended-size varint.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .max_type_meta_bytes(4096)
    .build();
```

**Default:** `4096`

### max_average_schema_versions_per_type(uint32_t)

Set the average accepted remote metadata versions across accepted remote types.
The effective global floor is `8192` schemas.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .max_average_schema_versions_per_type(3)
    .build();
```

**Default:** `3`

### check_struct_version(bool)

Enable/disable struct version checking.

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .compatible(false)
    .check_struct_version(true)  // Enable version checking
    .build();
```

When enabled, validates type hashes to detect schema mismatches.

**Default:** `false`

## Thread-Safe vs Single-Threaded

### Single-Threaded (Fastest)

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder().build();  // Returns Fory
```

Single-threaded `Fory` is the fastest option, but NOT thread-safe. Use one instance per thread.

### Thread-Safe

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder().build_thread_safe();  // Returns ThreadSafeFory
```

`ThreadSafeFory` uses a pool of Fory instances to provide thread-safe serialization. Slightly slower due to pool overhead, but safe to use from multiple threads concurrently.

## Security

Security-related configuration:

- Register all structs and polymorphic implementations before deserializing untrusted payloads.
- Use `check_struct_version(true)` with `compatible(false)` for intentional same-schema payloads.
- Keep `max_graph_memory_bytes(...)` at the fixed `128 MiB` default for most inputs, or set a
  positive value for a trusted workload that needs a different collection/map/struct gate.
- Keep `max_dyn_depth(...)` as low as your model permits to reject unexpectedly deep polymorphic
  graphs.
- Keep the remote schema metadata limits at their defaults unless the data is not malicious and a
  trusted peer sends larger metadata or many schema versions.
- Prefer concrete fields over broad polymorphic fields for untrusted input.
