C++ native serialization is the C++-only wire mode selected with `.xlang(false)`. Use it when every
writer and reader is C++ and the payload should follow C++ type behavior instead of the portable
xlang type system.

Use [Xlang Serialization](xlang-serialization.md), the default C++ mode, when
bytes must be read by Java, Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Swift,
Dart, Scala, Kotlin, or another non-C++ Fory implementation.

## When To Use Native Serialization

Use native serialization when:

- A payload is produced and consumed only by C++ applications.
- The data model uses C++-specific types such as character types, unsigned-native type IDs,
  `std::tuple`, smart pointers, or C++ polymorphic models.
- You want faster serialization and smaller size, and every reader uses the same schema as the
  writer.
- You need compatible schema evolution for C++-only rolling deployments.
- You want to avoid portable xlang type-mapping constraints for a C++ boundary.

## Create a Native-Mode Fory Instance

```cpp
#include "fory/serialization/fory.h"
#include <cassert>
#include <cstdint>
#include <string>

using namespace fory::serialization;

struct Order {
  int64_t id;
  double amount;

  bool operator==(const Order &other) const {
    return id == other.id && amount == other.amount;
  }
};
FORY_STRUCT(Order, id, amount);

int main() {
  auto fory = Fory::builder()
      .xlang(false)
      .build();
  fory.register_struct<Order>(100);

  Order order{1, 42.5};
  auto bytes = fory.serialize(order).value();
  auto decoded = fory.deserialize<Order>(bytes).value();
  assert(order == decoded);
}
```

Use one configured `Fory` instance per thread, or build a thread-safe Fory instance when the same instance
is shared by multiple threads:

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .xlang(false)
    .track_ref(true)
    .build_thread_safe();
```

Register types before concurrent serialization starts.

## Schema Evolution

Native serialization defaults to compatible mode. Keep that default when C++-only writer and reader
schemas can differ:

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .xlang(false)
    .build();
```

Compatible mode writes schema metadata so readers can tolerate added, removed, or reordered fields
when field identity remains compatible. See [Schema Evolution](schema-evolution.md).

For faster serialization and smaller size, set `.compatible(false)` only when
every reader and writer always uses the same C++ schema.

## Registration

Register structs with stable IDs or names before serialization:

```cpp
fory.register_struct<Order>(100);
fory.register_struct<Order>("example.Order");
```

Use numeric IDs for compact payloads. Use name registration when independent teams coordinate type
identity by names; add a namespace prefix with `.` when needed.

## C++ Object Surface

Native serialization owns the C++-specific object surface:

- Structs and classes described by `FORY_STRUCT`.
- Standard containers such as `std::vector`, `std::map`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::set`, and
  `std::unordered_set`.
- `std::optional`, `std::variant`, and tuple-like values.
- `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`.
- Character types such as `char`, `char16_t`, and `char32_t`.
- Unsigned integer types with native-mode type IDs.
- Polymorphic serialization registered through the C++ implementation.

Use [Supported Types](supported-types.md) for the full type surface and xlang mapping notes.

## References And Smart Pointers

Native serialization supports smart pointers and reference tracking:

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder()
    .xlang(false)
    .track_ref(true)
    .build();
```

When reference tracking is enabled, shared pointer identity can be preserved and cyclic object
graphs can be represented through supported pointer patterns. Disable reference tracking for
value-shaped data when identity is not part of the model.

## Native-Only Scalar Shapes

Some C++ scalar shapes are not portable xlang payloads. Use native serialization when these shapes
must round-trip as C++ values:

```cpp
auto fory = Fory::builder().xlang(false).build();

auto char_bytes = fory.serialize(char32_t{U'A'}).value();
auto value = fory.deserialize<char32_t>(char_bytes).value();

auto unsigned_bytes = fory.serialize(uint64_t{42}).value();
auto unsigned_value = fory.deserialize<uint64_t>(unsigned_bytes).value();
```

For xlang payloads, use metadata and the shared xlang type mapping instead of relying on
C++ native-only type IDs.

## Performance Guidelines

- Reuse configured `Fory` instances.
- Use single-threaded `Fory` per thread for the fastest path; use `build_thread_safe()` for shared
  concurrent use.
- Use `.compatible(false)` only when every reader and writer always uses the same C++ schema and
  the application wants faster serialization and smaller size.
- Register structs with explicit numeric IDs for compact payloads.
- Disable reference tracking for value-shaped graphs.
- Prefer concrete types over polymorphic/dynamic fields on hot paths.

## Native And Xlang Comparison

| Requirement                              | Use native serialization | Use xlang serialization |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| C++-only payloads                        | Yes                      | Optional                |
| Non-C++ readers or writers               | No                       | Yes                     |
| C++ native character and unsigned shapes | Yes                      | Limited                 |
| Smart pointers and C++ object graphs     | Yes                      | Limited                 |
| Same-schema compact payloads             | Yes                      | No                      |
| Compatible schema evolution by default   | Yes                      | Yes                     |
| Portable type mapping across languages   | No                       | Yes                     |

## Troubleshooting

### A non-C++ implementation cannot read the payload

The writer is using native serialization. Rebuild it with `.xlang(true)` and align type
registration with every peer.

### A rolling deployment fails after a field change

Native serialization defaults to compatible mode. Keep that default when schemas can differ.

### A native-only scalar does not map to another language

Use xlang serialization with explicit metadata for portable payloads. Native C++ type IDs
are only for C++ readers.

### A shared pointer graph loses identity

Enable `.track_ref(true)` and verify the graph uses supported pointer patterns.
