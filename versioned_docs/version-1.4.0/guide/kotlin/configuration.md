This page covers Kotlin-specific Fory instance configuration and creation.

## Xlang Setup

Fory Kotlin follows the Java builder default: xlang mode with compatible schema
evolution. Use this path for cross-language Kotlin payloads, schema IDL
generated Kotlin models, and KSP-generated xlang serializers.

```kotlin
import org.apache.fory.kotlin.ForyKotlin

val fory = ForyKotlin.builder()
    .withXlang(true)
    .requireClassRegistration(true)
    .build()
```

## Native Mode Setup

For same-language Kotlin/JVM payloads that need native JVM object behavior, use
native mode explicitly:

```kotlin
import org.apache.fory.kotlin.ForyKotlin

val fory = ForyKotlin.builder().withXlang(false)
    .requireClassRegistration(true)
    .build()
```

## Thread Safety

Fory instance creation is not cheap. Instances should be shared between multiple serializations.

### Single-Thread Usage

```kotlin
import org.apache.fory.Fory
import org.apache.fory.kotlin.ForyKotlin

object ForyHolder {
    val fory: Fory = ForyKotlin.builder()
        .withXlang(true)
        .requireClassRegistration(true)
        .build()
}
```

### Multi-Thread Usage

For multi-threaded applications, use `ThreadSafeFory`:

```kotlin
import org.apache.fory.ThreadSafeFory
import org.apache.fory.kotlin.ForyKotlin

object ForyHolder {
    val fory: ThreadSafeFory = ForyKotlin.builder()
        .withXlang(true)
        .requireClassRegistration(true)
        .buildThreadSafeFory()
}
```

### Using Builder Methods

```kotlin
// Thread-safe Fory
val fory: ThreadSafeFory = ForyKotlin.builder()
    .withXlang(true)
    .requireClassRegistration(true)
    .buildThreadSafeFory()
```

## Configuration

All configuration options from Fory Java are available. See [Java Configuration](../java/configuration.md) for the complete list.

Common options for Kotlin native-mode payloads:

```kotlin
import org.apache.fory.kotlin.ForyKotlin

val fory = ForyKotlin.builder().withXlang(false)
    // Enable reference tracking for circular references
    .withRefTracking(true)
    // Same-schema optimization. Use only when every reader and writer
    // always uses the same Kotlin/JVM schema.
    .withCompatible(false)
    // Enable async compilation for better startup performance
    .withAsyncCompilation(true)
    // Compression options
    .withIntCompressed(true)
    .withLongCompressed(true)
    .build()
```

### Graph Memory Budget

Kotlin uses the Java `withMaxGraphMemoryBytes(...)` option. It sets an approximate graph-memory gate
for one root deserialization, mainly for materialized collections, maps, arrays, structs, and
objects. It skips leaf values such as strings, binary data, primitive scalars, and dense primitive
arrays, so actual process memory can be higher than this value. Leaf values are still gated by
remaining input bytes: if the unread input does not contain enough bytes, Fory will not read or
create that leaf value.

```kotlin
val fory = ForyKotlin.builder()
    .withMaxGraphMemoryBytes(128L * 1024 * 1024)
    .build()
```

## Compatible Mode

Compatible mode is enabled by default through the Java builder in both xlang and native mode. Keep
this default when models may evolve independently, when services deploy separately, or when xlang
schemas are written by hand in different languages.

Use `withCompatible(false)` only when the class schema used to deserialize every payload is always
the same as the class schema used to serialize it and you want faster serialization and smaller size.
For xlang payloads, call `withCompatible(false)` only after verifying that every language uses the same schema, or when native types are generated from Fory schema IDL.

## Security

Kotlin uses the Java configuration surface. Keep class registration enabled for production
and any untrusted payload source:

```kotlin
val fory = ForyKotlin.builder()
    .requireClassRegistration(true)
    .withMaxDepth(50)
    .withMaxGraphMemoryBytes(128L * 1024 * 1024)
    .withMaxTypeFields(512)
    .withMaxTypeMetaBytes(4096)
    .build()
```

Security-related configuration:

- Keep `requireClassRegistration(true)` and register application classes or generated modules.
- Use `withMaxDepth(...)` to reject unexpectedly deep object graphs.
- Use `withMaxGraphMemoryBytes(...)` as an approximate gate for collection, map, array, struct, and
  object-heavy payloads. It is not an exact heap cap; leaf values are gated by remaining input
  bytes.
- Keep `withMaxTypeFields(...)`, `withMaxTypeMetaBytes(...)`, and the remote schema-version limits
  at their defaults unless the data is not malicious and a trusted peer sends larger metadata or
  many schema versions.
- Follow [Java Configuration](../java/configuration.md#security) for allow-listing and unknown-class
  controls.
