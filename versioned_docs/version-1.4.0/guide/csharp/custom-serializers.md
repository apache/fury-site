Use custom serializers when a type is not generated with `[ForyStruct]` or requires specialized encoding.

## Implement `Serializer<T>`

```csharp
using Apache.Fory;

public sealed class Point
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }
}

public sealed class PointSerializer : Serializer<Point>
{
    public override Point DefaultValue => new();

    public override void WriteData(WriteContext context, in Point value, bool hasGenerics)
    {
        context.Writer.WriteVarInt32(value.X);
        context.Writer.WriteVarInt32(value.Y);
    }

    public override Point ReadData(ReadContext context)
    {
        return new Point
        {
            X = context.Reader.ReadVarInt32(),
            Y = context.Reader.ReadVarInt32(),
        };
    }
}
```

## Register the Serializer

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder().Build();
fory.Register<Point, PointSerializer>(200);

Point value = new() { X = 10, Y = 20 };
byte[] payload = fory.Serialize(value);
Point decoded = fory.Deserialize<Point>(payload);
```

Use the named overload when peers identify the type by name instead of a numeric ID:

```csharp
fory.Register<Point, PointSerializer>("com.example.Point");
```

## Serializer Behavior Notes

- `WriteData` / `ReadData` only handle payload content.
- Ref flags and type info are handled by base `Serializer<T>.Write` / `Read` unless overridden.
- `DefaultValue` is used for null/default fallback paths.

## Best Practices

1. Keep serializers deterministic and symmetric.
2. Use varint/fixed/tagged encoding intentionally for integer-heavy payloads.
3. Register custom serializers on all reader/writer peers.
4. Prefer generated `[ForyStruct]` serializers for normal domain models.
