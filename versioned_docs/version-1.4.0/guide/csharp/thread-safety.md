Apache Fory™ C# provides two Fory instance forms with different threading guarantees.

## `Fory` (Single-Threaded Instance)

`Fory` is optimized for single-threaded reuse and must not be used concurrently by multiple threads.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder().Build();
```

Use one `Fory` instance per thread when managing thread affinity explicitly.

## `ThreadSafeFory` (Concurrent Wrapper)

`ThreadSafeFory` wraps one `Fory` instance per thread and exposes thread-safe APIs.

```csharp
using Apache.Fory;

using ThreadSafeFory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .TrackRef(true)
    .BuildThreadSafe();

fory.Register<MyType>(100);

Parallel.For(0, 64, i =>
{
    byte[] payload = fory.Serialize(i);
    int decoded = fory.Deserialize<int>(payload);
});
```

## Registration Behavior

- `ThreadSafeFory.Register(...)` stores registrations centrally.
- Existing per-thread Fory instances are updated.
- New threads receive all previous registrations automatically.

## Disposal

`ThreadSafeFory` implements `IDisposable` and should be disposed when no longer needed.

```csharp
using ThreadSafeFory fory = Fory.Builder().BuildThreadSafe();
```
