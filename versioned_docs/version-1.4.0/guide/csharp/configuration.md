This page covers `ForyBuilder` options and default configuration values for Apache Fory™ C#.
`Config` is an immutable configuration snapshot created by `ForyBuilder`.

## Build a Fory Instance

```csharp
using Apache.Fory;

Fory fory = Fory.Builder().Build();
ThreadSafeFory threadSafe = Fory.Builder().BuildThreadSafe();
```

## Default Configuration

`Fory.Builder().Build()` uses:

| Option                            | Default     | Description                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `TrackRef`                        | `false`     | Reference tracking disabled                       |
| `Compatible`                      | `true`      | Compatible schema-evolution metadata enabled      |
| `CheckStructVersion`              | `false`     | Struct schema hash checks disabled                |
| `MaxDepth`                        | `20`        | Max dynamic nesting depth                         |
| `MaxGraphMemoryBytes`             | `134217728` | Approximate graph-memory gate per root read       |
| `MaxTypeFields`                   | `512`       | Max fields in one received struct metadata body   |
| `MaxTypeMetaBytes`                | `4096`      | Max encoded bytes in one received metadata body   |
| `MaxSchemaVersionsPerType`        | `10`        | Max remote metadata versions for one logical type |
| `MaxAverageSchemaVersionsPerType` | `3`         | Average remote metadata versions across types     |

## Builder Options

C# always uses xlang-compatible framing, so `ForyBuilder` does not expose a mode toggle.

### `TrackRef(bool enabled = false)`

Enables reference tracking for shared/circular object graphs.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .TrackRef(true)
    .Build();
```

### `Compatible(bool enabled = false)`

Enables schema evolution mode. C# uses the xlang wire format only, so compatible mode is enabled by
default for independently deployed peers. Use `.Build()` without calling this method for the
default compatible mode. Passing `false`, or calling `Compatible()` without an argument, opts into
same-schema payloads. Use that only when every reader and writer always uses the same schema and you want faster serialization and smaller size. For cross-language payloads, call `Compatible(false)` only after verifying that every peer uses the same schema, or when native types are generated from Fory schema IDL.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .Compatible(false)
    .Build();
```

### `CheckStructVersion(bool enabled = false)`

Checks the schema hash when you intentionally use same-schema payloads.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .Compatible(false)
    .CheckStructVersion(true)
    .Build();
```

### `MaxDepth(int value)`

Sets max nesting depth for dynamic object graphs.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .MaxDepth(32)
    .Build();
```

`value` must be greater than `0`.

### `MaxGraphMemoryBytes(long value)`

Sets an approximate graph-memory gate for one root deserialization. The estimate mainly covers
materialized collections, maps, arrays, structs, and objects. It skips leaf values such as strings,
binary data, primitive scalars, and dense primitive arrays, so actual process memory can be higher
than this value.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .MaxGraphMemoryBytes(64L * 1024 * 1024)
    .Build();
```

The default limit is a fixed `128 MiB` for all root input forms. A positive value overrides the
default. Explicit non-positive values are rejected when the runtime is created. Skipped leaf values
are still gated by remaining input bytes: if the unread input does not contain enough bytes, Fory
will not read or create that leaf value.

### `MaxTypeFields(int value)`

Sets the maximum fields accepted in one received remote struct metadata body.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .MaxTypeFields(512)
    .Build();
```

### `MaxTypeMetaBytes(int value)`

Sets the maximum encoded body bytes accepted for one received TypeMeta body,
excluding the 8-byte header and any extended-size varint.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .MaxTypeMetaBytes(4096)
    .Build();
```

### `MaxSchemaVersionsPerType(int value)`

Sets the maximum accepted remote metadata versions for one logical type.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .MaxSchemaVersionsPerType(10)
    .Build();
```

### `MaxAverageSchemaVersionsPerType(int value)`

Sets the average accepted remote metadata versions across accepted remote types.
The effective global floor is `8192` schemas.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .MaxAverageSchemaVersionsPerType(3)
    .Build();
```

## Common Configurations

### Compatible service

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .TrackRef(true)
    .Build();
```

### Same-schema optimization

Use this only when every reader and writer always uses the same schema.

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .Compatible(false)
    .Build();
```

### Thread-safe service instance

```csharp
ThreadSafeFory fory = Fory.Builder()
    .TrackRef(true)
    .BuildThreadSafe();
```

## Security

Security-related configuration:

- Register only the expected types before deserializing untrusted payloads.
- Use `CheckStructVersion(true)` with `Compatible(false)` for intentional same-schema payloads.
- Set `MaxDepth(...)` to reject unexpectedly deep dynamic object graphs.
- Set `MaxGraphMemoryBytes(...)` as an approximate gate for collection, map, array, struct, and
  object-heavy payloads. It is not an exact heap cap; leaf values are gated by remaining input bytes.
- Keep the remote schema metadata limits at their defaults unless the data is not malicious and a
  trusted peer sends larger metadata or many schema versions.
- Prefer generated or registered concrete models over broad dynamic fields for untrusted input.
