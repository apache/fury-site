Fory supports pickle5-compatible out-of-band buffer serialization for efficient zero-copy handling of large data structures.

## Overview

Out-of-band serialization separates metadata from the actual data buffers, allowing for:

- **Zero-copy transfers** when sending data over networks or IPC using `memoryview`
- **Improved performance** for large datasets
- **Pickle5 compatibility** using `pickle.PickleBuffer`
- **Flexible stream support** - write to any writable object (files, BytesIO, sockets, etc.)

## Basic Out-of-Band Serialization

```python
import pyfory
import numpy as np

fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=False, ref=False, strict=False)

# Large numpy array
array = np.arange(10000, dtype=np.float64)

# Serialize with out-of-band buffers
buffer_objects = []
serialized_data = fory.serialize(array, buffer_callback=buffer_objects.append)

# Convert buffer objects to memoryview for zero-copy transmission
# For contiguous buffers (bytes, numpy arrays), this is zero-copy
# For non-contiguous data, a copy may be created to ensure contiguity
buffers = [obj.getbuffer() for obj in buffer_objects]

# Deserialize with out-of-band buffers (accepts memoryview, bytes, or Buffer)
deserialized_array = fory.deserialize(serialized_data, buffers=buffers)

assert np.array_equal(array, deserialized_array)
```

## Out-of-Band with Pandas DataFrames

```python
import pyfory
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=False, ref=False, strict=False)

# Create a DataFrame with numeric columns
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'a': np.arange(1000, dtype=np.float64),
    'b': np.arange(1000, dtype=np.int64),
    'c': ['text'] * 1000
})

# Serialize with out-of-band buffers
buffer_objects = []
serialized_data = fory.serialize(df, buffer_callback=buffer_objects.append)
buffers = [obj.getbuffer() for obj in buffer_objects]

# Deserialize
deserialized_df = fory.deserialize(serialized_data, buffers=buffers)

assert df.equals(deserialized_df)
```

## Selective Out-of-Band Serialization

Control which buffers go out-of-band by providing a callback that returns `True` to keep data in-band or `False` to send it out-of-band:

```python
import pyfory
import numpy as np

fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=False, ref=True, strict=False)

arr1 = np.arange(1000, dtype=np.float64)
arr2 = np.arange(2000, dtype=np.float64)
data = [arr1, arr2]

buffer_objects = []
counter = 0

def selective_callback(buffer_object):
    global counter
    counter += 1
    # Only send even-numbered buffers out-of-band
    if counter % 2 == 0:
        buffer_objects.append(buffer_object)
        return False  # Out-of-band
    return True  # In-band

serialized = fory.serialize(data, buffer_callback=selective_callback)
buffers = [obj.getbuffer() for obj in buffer_objects]
deserialized = fory.deserialize(serialized, buffers=buffers)
```

## Pickle5 Compatibility

Fory's out-of-band serialization is fully compatible with pickle protocol 5:

```python
import pyfory
import pickle

fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=False, ref=False, strict=False)

# PickleBuffer objects are automatically supported
data = b"Large binary data"
pickle_buffer = pickle.PickleBuffer(data)

# Serialize with buffer callback for out-of-band handling
buffer_objects = []
serialized = fory.serialize(pickle_buffer, buffer_callback=buffer_objects.append)
buffers = [obj.getbuffer() for obj in buffer_objects]

# Deserialize with buffers
deserialized = fory.deserialize(serialized, buffers=buffers)
assert bytes(deserialized.raw()) == data
```

## Writing Buffers to Different Streams

The `BufferObject.write_to()` method accepts any writable stream object:

```python
import pyfory
import numpy as np
import io

fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=False, ref=False, strict=False)

array = np.arange(1000, dtype=np.float64)

# Collect out-of-band buffers
buffer_objects = []
serialized = fory.serialize(array, buffer_callback=buffer_objects.append)

# Write to different stream types
for buffer_obj in buffer_objects:
    # Write to BytesIO (in-memory stream)
    bytes_stream = io.BytesIO()
    buffer_obj.write_to(bytes_stream)

    # Write to file
    with open('/tmp/buffer_data.bin', 'wb') as f:
        buffer_obj.write_to(f)

    # Get zero-copy memoryview (for contiguous buffers)
    mv = buffer_obj.getbuffer()
    assert isinstance(mv, memoryview)
```

**Note**: For contiguous memory buffers (like bytes, numpy arrays), `getbuffer()` returns a zero-copy `memoryview`. For non-contiguous data, a copy may be created to ensure contiguity.
