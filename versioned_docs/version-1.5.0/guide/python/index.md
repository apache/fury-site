**Apache Fory™** is a blazing fast multi-language serialization framework powered by **JIT compilation** and **zero-copy** techniques, providing up to **ultra-fast performance** while maintaining ease of use and safety.

`pyfory` provides the Python implementation of Apache Fory™, offering xlang mode for cross-language payloads, native mode for Python-only object serialization, and advanced row-format capabilities for data processing tasks.

## Key Features

### Flexible Serialization Modes

- **Xlang mode**: Default cross-language wire format with compatible schema evolution
- **Python native mode**: Same-language mode and drop-in replacement for pickle/cloudpickle
- **Row Format**: Zero-copy row format for analytics workloads

### Versatile Serialization Features

- **Reference tracking** for shared xlang schema objects and Python native-mode circular graphs
- **Polymorphism support** for customized types with automatic type dispatching
- **Schema evolution** support for backward/forward compatibility when using dataclasses in xlang mode
- **Out-of-band buffer support** for zero-copy serialization of large data structures like NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames, compatible with pickle protocol 5

### Blazing Fast Performance

- **Extremely fast performance** compared to other serialization frameworks
- **Runtime code generation** and **Cython-accelerated** core implementation for optimal performance

### Compact Data Size

- **Compact object graph protocol** with minimal space overhead—up to 3× size reduction compared to pickle/cloudpickle
- **Meta packing and sharing** to minimize type forward/backward compatibility space overhead

### Security & Safety

- **Strict mode** prevents deserialization of untrusted types by type registration and checks.
- **Reference tracking** for handling circular references safely

## Installation

### Basic Installation

```bash
pip install pyfory
```

### Optional Dependencies

```bash
# Install with row format support (requires Apache Arrow)
pip install pyfory[format]

# Install from source for development
git clone https://github.com/apache/fory.git
cd fory/python
pip install -e ".[dev,format]"
```

### Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **OS**: Linux, macOS, Windows

## Thread Safety

`pyfory` provides `ThreadSafeFory` for thread-safe serialization using a pooled wrapper:

```python
import pyfory
import threading
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int

# Create a thread-safe xlang Fory instance
fory = pyfory.ThreadSafeFory(xlang=True, ref=True)
fory.register(Person)

# Use in multiple threads safely
def serialize_in_thread(thread_id):
    person = Person(name=f"User{thread_id}", age=25 + thread_id)
    data = fory.serialize(person)
    result = fory.deserialize(data)
    print(f"Thread {thread_id}: {result}")

threads = [threading.Thread(target=serialize_in_thread, args=(i,)) for i in range(10)]
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()
```

**Key Features:**

- **Instance Pool**: Maintains a pool of `Fory` instances protected by a lock for thread safety
- **Shared Configuration**: All registrations must be done upfront and are applied to all instances
- **Same API**: Drop-in replacement for `Fory` class with identical methods
- **Registration Safety**: Prevents registration after first use to ensure consistency

**When to Use:**

- **Multi-threaded Applications**: Web servers, concurrent workers, parallel processing
- **Shared Fory Instances**: When multiple threads need to serialize/deserialize data
- **Thread Pools**: Applications using thread pools or concurrent.futures

## Quick Start

```python
import pyfory
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int

# Create an xlang Fory instance
fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=True, ref=True)
fory.register(Person)

person = Person("Alice", 30)
data = fory.serialize(person)
result = fory.deserialize(data)
print(result)  # Person(name='Alice', age=30)
```

## Xlang Mode And Native Mode

Use xlang mode for cross-language payloads and dataclass schemas shared with other Fory implementations. Xlang mode is the default Python wire mode, and Python examples that use it set `xlang=True` explicitly so the mode choice is visible.

Use native mode for Python-only traffic. Native mode is selected with `xlang=False` and owns pickle/cloudpickle-style behavior such as functions, lambdas, classes, methods, `__reduce__`, `__getstate__`, and out-of-band pickle protocol 5 buffers. It is optimized for Python's type system and supports a broader Python object surface than xlang mode, so use it when replacing pickle or cloudpickle. Compatible mode is enabled by default. Set `compatible=False` only when every reader and writer uses the same Python class schema and you want faster serialization and smaller size.

See [Native Serialization](native-serialization.md) for Python-only serialization details and [Xlang Serialization](xlang-serialization.md) for Python xlang registration and interoperability rules.
