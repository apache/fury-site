**Apache Fory™** is a blazingly-fast multi-language serialization framework for
idiomatic domain objects, schema IDL, and cross-language data exchange.

Fory is built for compact, high-throughput serialization across languages and
runtimes. It works directly with application objects, supports shared schemas
when you need a stable contract, and preserves object graph features such as
shared references, circular references, and polymorphic runtime types.

## Quick Example

Cross-language serialization — serialize in Rust, deserialize in Python:

**Rust**

```rust
use fory::{Fory, ForyObject};

#[derive(ForyObject, Debug, PartialEq)]
struct User {
    name: String,
    age: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut fory = Fory::default().xlang(true);
    fory.register::<User>(1);

    let user = User { name: "Alice".to_string(), age: 30 };
    let bytes = fory.serialize(&user).unwrap();
    let decoded: User = fory.deserialize(&bytes).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", decoded);  // User { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
}
```

**Python**

```python
import pyfory
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    age: pyfory.int32

fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=True)
fory.register(User, type_id=1)

user = User(name="Alice", age=30)
data = fory.serialize(user)
decoded = fory.deserialize(data)
print(decoded)  # User(name='Alice', age=30)
```

## Key Features

### Efficient Cross-Language Encoding

The **[xlang serialization format](../specification/xlang_serialization_spec.md)**
exchanges compact binary payloads across supported languages:

- **Compact metadata**: Type metadata and field information are packed to keep payloads small.
- **Schema evolution**: Compatible mode supports forward and backward evolution for application schemas.
- **Object graph semantics**: Shared references, circular references, and polymorphic runtime types are preserved across runtimes.
- **Type mapping**: Language-specific values are mapped through the shared [type mapping](../specification/xlang_type_mapping.md).

### Domain Objects First

Fory serializes native domain objects directly instead of forcing applications
through wrapper types:

- Java classes, Scala/Kotlin types, and GraalVM native image workloads.
- Python dataclasses and Python-native object graphs.
- Go structs, Rust structs, C++ structs, C# models, Swift types, Dart models, and JavaScript/TypeScript values.
- Generated or annotated types when a shared contract is preferred.

### Reference-Aware Schema IDL

**[Fory IDL and the compiler](../compiler/index.md)** let teams define schemas
once and generate native domain objects for each target language:

- Model numbers, strings, lists, maps, arrays, enums, structs, and unions.
- Express shared and circular references directly in the schema.
- Generate idiomatic host-language code without introducing transport-specific wrapper types into user code.
- Use schema IDL when services need a stable contract across independently maintained runtimes.

### Row-Format Random Access

A cache-friendly **[row format](../specification/row_format_spec.md)** is
optimized for analytics and partial-read workloads:

- **Zero-copy random access**: Read fields, arrays, and nested values without rebuilding whole objects.
- **Partial operations**: Read only the values needed for a query or pipeline stage.
- **Apache Arrow integration**: Convert to columnar data for analytics pipelines.
- **Multi-language support**: Use row format from Java, Python, Rust, and C++.

### Optimized Runtimes

Fory keeps hot paths fast without making every runtime use the same implementation strategy:

- **Java JIT serializers**: Runtime code generation eliminates reflection overhead and inlines hot paths.
- **Generated and static serializers**: Other runtimes use generated or static serializers where appropriate.
- **Zero-copy paths**: Row format and out-of-band buffers avoid unnecessary copies for large values.
- **Metadata sharing**: Repeated type information is shared or packed to reduce serialization overhead.
