This page explains how Apache Fory consumes FlatBuffers schemas (`.fbs`) and
translates them into Fory IR for code generation.

## What This Page Covers

- When to use FlatBuffers input with Fory
- Exact FlatBuffers to Fory mapping behavior
- Supported Fory-specific attributes in `.fbs`
- Adoption notes and generated-code differences

## Why Use Apache Fory

- Idiomatic generated code: Fory generates language-idiomatic classes/structs
  that can be used directly as domain objects.
- Java performance: In Java object-serialization workloads, Fory is faster than
  FlatBuffers in Fory benchmarks.
- Other languages: serialization performance is generally in a similar range.
- Deserialization in practice: FlatBuffers can be faster when callers read
  directly from its buffer, but applications that need native objects still
  require conversion, and that conversion step can dominate read cost. In those
  cases, Fory deserialization is often faster end-to-end.
- Easier APIs: Fory uses direct native objects, so you do not need to
  reverse-build tables or manually manage offsets.
- Better graph modeling: Shared and circular references are first-class features
  in Fory.

## Quick Decision Guide

| Situation                                                          | Recommended Path       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| You already have `.fbs` schemas and want Fory APIs/codegen         | Use FlatBuffers input  |
| You are starting new schema work and want full Fory syntax control | Use native Fory IDL    |
| You need FlatBuffers wire compatibility                            | Keep FlatBuffers stack |
| You need Fory object-graph semantics (`ref`, weak refs, etc.)      | Use Fory               |

## FlatBuffers to Fory Mapping

### Schema-Level Rules

- `namespace` maps to Fory package namespace.
- `include` entries map to Fory imports.
- `table` is translated as `evolving=true`.
- `struct` is translated as `evolving=false`.
- `root_type` is parsed but ignored by Fory codegen.
- `file_identifier` and `file_extension` are parsed but not used by Fory codegen.

### Field Numbering

FlatBuffers fields do not have explicit field IDs. Fory assigns field numbers by
source declaration order, starting at `1`.

### Scalar Type Mapping

| FlatBuffers | Fory Type |
| ----------- | --------- |
| `byte`      | `int8`    |
| `ubyte`     | `uint8`   |
| `short`     | `int16`   |
| `ushort`    | `uint16`  |
| `int`       | `int32`   |
| `uint`      | `uint32`  |
| `long`      | `int64`   |
| `ulong`     | `uint64`  |
| `float`     | `float32` |
| `double`    | `float64` |
| `bool`      | `bool`    |
| `string`    | `string`  |

Vectors (`[T]`) map to Fory lists.

### Unions

FlatBuffers unions map to Fory unions.

- Case IDs are assigned by declaration order, starting at `1`.
- Case names are derived from type names using snake_case field naming.

**FlatBuffers**

```fbs
union Payload {
  Note,
  Metric
}

table Container {
  payload: Payload;
}
```

**Fory shape after translation**

```protobuf
union Payload {
    Note note = 1;
    Metric metric = 2;
}

message Container {
    Payload payload = 1;
}
```

### Services

FlatBuffers `rpc_service` definitions are translated to Fory services. With
`--grpc`, the compiler emits gRPC service companions for supported outputs such
as Java, Python, Go, Rust, C#, Dart, Scala, Kotlin, and JavaScript. JavaScript
browser clients are generated with `--grpc-web`. These companions use Fory
serialization for request and response payloads.

```fbs
rpc_service SearchService {
  Lookup(SearchRequest):SearchResponse;
  StreamLookup(SearchRequest):SearchResponse (streaming: "server");
}
```

```bash
foryc api.fbs --java_out=./generated/java --python_out=./generated/python --go_out=./generated/go --rust_out=./generated/rust --csharp_out=./generated/csharp --dart_out=./generated/dart --scala_out=./generated/scala --kotlin_out=./generated/kotlin --javascript_out=./generated/javascript --grpc
```

Generated service code imports grpc APIs, so applications must provide grpc-java,
grpc-kotlin, Scala grpc-java APIs, `grpcio`, grpc-go, Rust `tonic` and `bytes`,
`@grpc/grpc-js`, C# `Grpc.Core.Api` plus server/client dependencies, or Dart
`package:grpc` when they compile or run those files. Python companions use
`grpc.aio` by default and can be generated in sync mode with
`--grpc-python-mode=sync`. Fory packages do not add gRPC as a hard dependency.
Use `--grpc-web` with JavaScript output to generate browser clients that import
`grpc-web`.

### Defaults and Metadata

- FlatBuffers default values are parsed but not applied as Fory defaults.
- Non-Fory metadata attributes are preserved as generic options in IR and may be
  consumed by downstream tooling.

## Fory-Specific Attributes in FlatBuffers

FlatBuffers metadata attributes use `key:value`. For Fory-specific options, use
`fory_` (or `fory.`) prefix in `.fbs`; the prefix is removed during parsing.

### Supported Field Attributes

| FlatBuffers Attribute            | Effect in Fory                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fory_ref:true`                  | Enable reference tracking for the field                                          |
| `fory_nullable:true`             | Mark field optional/nullable                                                     |
| `fory_weak_ref:true`             | Enable weak reference semantics and implies `ref`                                |
| `fory_thread_safe_pointer:false` | For ref fields, select Rust `Rc`/`RcWeak` instead of the default `Arc`/`ArcWeak` |

Semantics:

- `fory_weak_ref:true` implies `ref`.
- `fory_thread_safe_pointer` defaults to `true`, only takes effect when the field
  is ref-tracked, and does not change the wire format.
- In Rust codegen, `fory_weak_ref:true` uses `ArcWeak` by default and switches to
  `RcWeak` only when `fory_thread_safe_pointer:false` is set.
- For list fields, `fory_ref:true` applies to list elements.

Example:

```fbs
table Node {
  parent: Node (fory_weak_ref: true);
  children: [Node] (fory_ref: true);
  local: Node (fory_ref: true, fory_thread_safe_pointer: false);
}
```

## Generated Code Differences

Using `.fbs` as input to Fory still produces normal Fory-generated code, not
FlatBuffers `ByteBuffer`-style APIs.

- Java, Scala, and Kotlin: JVM model types with Fory metadata and registration helpers
- Python: dataclasses plus registration helpers
- C++, Go, and Rust: native structs and Fory metadata
- JavaScript/TypeScript: TypeScript interfaces and schema helpers
- C#, Swift, and Dart: annotated or macro-based model types with registration helpers

The serialization format is Fory binary protocol, not FlatBuffers wire format.

## Usage

Compile a FlatBuffers schema directly:

```bash
foryc schema.fbs --lang java,python --output ./generated
```

Inspect translated schema syntax for debugging:

```bash
foryc schema.fbs --emit-fdl --emit-fdl-path ./translated
```

## Adoption Notes

1. Keep existing `namespace` values stable to keep type registration stable.
2. Review fields that relied on FlatBuffers default literals and set explicit
   defaults in application code if needed.
3. Add `fory_ref`/`fory_weak_ref` where object-graph semantics are required.
4. Validate generated model behavior with roundtrip tests before replacing
   existing serialization paths.

## Summary

FlatBuffers input lets you reuse existing `.fbs` schemas while moving to Fory's
serialization and code generation model. This is useful for incremental adoption
while preserving schema investment and using Fory-native object APIs.
