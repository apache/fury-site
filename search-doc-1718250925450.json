Data transfer between processes, languages, nodes, or object persistence, state read-write and copy, all need serialization. The performance and ease-of-use of serialization affects runtime and development efficiency of the system.  Static serialization frameworks like Protobuf or FlatBuffers cannot be used for cross-language application development directly, because they don't support shared reference and polymorphism, and also need to generate code ahead.  Dynamic serialization frameworks such as JDK serialization, Kryo, Fst, Hessian, Pickle provide ease-of-use and dynamics, but don't support cross-language and suffer significant performance issues, which is unsuitable for high throughput, low latency, and large-scale data transfer scenarios.  Therefore, we developed a new multi-language serialization framework Apache Fury, which is open-sourced on https://github.com/apache/fury. Through highly optimized serialization primitives, JIT dynamic compilation and zero-copy technologies, Fury is both fast and easy-to-use.

Some serialization frameworks will write the binaries into an intermediate buffer and introduce multiple time-consuming memory copies. Fury implemented an out-of-band serialization protocol inspired by pickle5, Ray and Apache Arrow, which can capture all binary buffers in an object graph to avoid intermediate copies of these buffers.  The following figure shows the serialization process of zero-copy:    Currently, Fury supports the following types of zero-copy:  Java: all basic types of arrays, ByteBuffer, ArrowRecordBatch, and VectorSchemaRootPython: all arrays of the array module, numpy arrays, pyarrow.Table, and pyarrow.RecordBatchGolang: byte slice  You can also add the new zero copy type based on the Fury interface.

By inlining more methods, better code cache, reducing virtual method calls, conditional branches, hash lookup, metadata writes, and memory reads/writes, the serialization performance is greatly accelerated.  For Java, Fury implements a runtime codegen framework and defines an operator expression IR. Then fury can perform type inference based on the generic type information of the object at runtime to build an expression tree that describes the logic of serialized code.  The codegen framework will generate efficient Java code from the expression tree, then pass to Janino to compile it into bytecode, and load it into the user's ClassLoader or the ClassLoader created by Fury, and finally compile it into efficient assembly code through Java JIT.  Since JVM JIT skips Big method compilation and inlining, Fury also implements an optimizer to split big methods into small methods recursively, thus ensuring that all code can be compiled and inlined.    Fury also supports asynchronous multithreaded compilation by running the codegen tasks in a thread pool, and using interpretation mode until JIT finishes to ensure no serialization burrs. Users can skip warm up serialization of objects.  Python and JavaScript codegen are similar. Generating source code is easier for development and troubleshooting problems.  Since serialization will manipulate objects extensively in each programming language, and the language does not expose the low-level API of the memory model, native methods call has a large cost too, so we cannot use LLVM to build a unified serializer JIT framework. Instead, we implemented a codegen framework for every language separately.

We cannot generate serialization code dynamically for such languages through JIT.  In such scenarios, Fury is implementing an AOT codegen framework, which generates the serialized code statically according to the object schema, and objects can be serialized automatically using the generated serializer.

Kryo and Hessian have some correctness issues in these scenarios.Type compatibility: When the deserialization and serialization class schema are inconsistent, it can still deserialize correctly. It supports application upgrade and deployment, add/delete fields independently. Fury type-compatible mode is implemented with no performance loss compared to type-consistent mode.Metadata sharing : share metadata(class name, field name&amp;type, etc.) across multiple serializations under a context (TCP connection), meta will be sent to the peer only for the first serialization, the peer can reconstruct the same deserializer based on this information. Subsequent serialization will skip transferring metadata, which can reduce network traffic, and support type compatibility automatically.Zero-copy support: supports out-of-band zero copy and off-heap memory read and write.

Although frameworks like Protobuf or FlatBuffers support cross-language serialization, they still have limitations:  They require pre-defined IDLs and generate code statically ahead, lacking sufficient dynamics and flexibility;The generated classes don't conform to object-oriented design and it's impossible to add behavior to classes, which make them unsuitable for use as domain objects in cross-language application development.They don't support polymorphism. Object-oriented programming uses interfaces to invoke subclass methods, but this pattern isn't supported well in those frameworks. Although FlatBuffers offers Union, and Protobuf provides OneOf/Any, those API require check object type during serialization and deserialization, which isn't polymorphic.They don't support circular references and shared references. Users need to define a set of IDLs for domain objects and implement reference resolution by themselves, as well as writing code to convert between domain objects and protocol objects in each language. If the object graph depth is deep, more code needs to be written.  Due to the above limitations, Fury implemented a cross-language object graph serialization protocol that:  Automatically serializes any object across multiple languages: By defining classes in the serialization and deserialization peer, objects in one language can be automatically serialized into objects in another language without creating IDL files, compiling schema to generate code, or writing conversion code.Automatically serializes shared and circular references across multiple languages.Supports object type polymorphism, consistent with the object-oriented programming paradigm, and multiple subtypes can be automatically deserialized without manual intervention.Out-of-band zero-copy is also supported in this protocol.

If users only need to read part of the data or filter data based on some field of an object, deserializing the entire data will result in unnecessary overhead. Therefore, Fury provides a binary data structure for direct reading and writing on binary data to avoid serialization.  Apache Arrow is a standardized columnar storage format that supports binary read and write. However, columnar format is not suitable for all scenarios. Data in online and streaming computing are naturally stored row by row, and row is also used in columnar computing engines when involving data updates, Hash/Join/Aggregation operations.  However, there is no standardized implementation for row format. Computing engines such as Spark/Flink/Doris/Velox all defined their row format, which doesn't support cross-language and can only be used internally by themselves. FlatBuffers does support lazy deserialization, but it requires static compilation of schema IDL and management of offset, which is impossible for complex scenarios.  Therefore, Fury implemented a binary row format inspired by Spark Tungsten and Apache Arrow format, which allows random access and partial deserialization. Currently, Java/Python/C++ versions have been implemented, allowing direct reading and writing on binary data to avoid all serialization overhead, and can convert to arrow format automatically.

Those strings are mostly ascii strings. In order to transfer between processes, we encode such strings using utf-8 encodings. Such encoding will take one byte for every char, which is not space efficient actually.  If we take a deeper look, we will found that most chars are lowercase chars, ., $ and _, which can be expressed in a much smaller range 0~32. But one byte can represent range 0~255, the significant bits are wasted, and this cost is not ignorable. In a dynamic serialization framework, such meta will take considerable cost compared to actual data.  So we proposed a new string encoding algorithm which we called meta string encoding in Fury.

Class registration can not only reduce security risks, but also avoid classname serialization cost.  You can register class with API Fury#register.  Note that class registration order is important, serialization and deserialization peer should have same registration order.  Fury fury=xxx; fury.register(SomeClass.class); fury.register(SomeClass1.class,200);   If you invoke FuryBuilder#requireClassRegistration(false) to disable class registration check, you can set org.apache.fury.resolver.ClassChecker by ClassResolver#setClassChecker to control which classes are allowed for serialization. For example, you can allow classes started with org.example.* by:  Fury fury=xxx; fury.getClassResolver().setClassChecker((classResolver,className)-&gt;className.startsWith(&quot;org.example.&quot;));   AllowListChecker checker=new AllowListChecker(AllowListChecker.CheckLevel.STRICT); ThreadSafeFury fury=new ThreadLocalFury(classLoader-&gt;{ Fury f=Fury.builder().requireClassRegistration(true).withClassLoader(classLoader).build(); f.getClassResolver().setClassChecker(checker); checker.addListener(f.getClassResolver()); return f; }); checker.allowClass(&quot;org.example.*&quot;);   Fury also provided a org.apache.fury.resolver.AllowListChecker which is allowed/disallowed list based checker to simplify the customization of class check mechanism. You can use this checker or implement more sophisticated checker by yourself.

Normal mode(meta share not enabled): If type meta hasn't been written before, add type defto captured_type_defs: captured_type_defs[type def] = map size.Get index of the meta in captured_type_defs, write that index as | unsigned varint: index |.After finished the serialization of the object graph, fury will start to write captured_type_defs: Firstly, set current to meta start offset of fury headerThen write captured_type_defs one by one: buffer.write_var_uint32(len(writting_type_defs) - len(schema_consistent_type_def_stubs)) for type_meta in writting_type_defs: if not type_meta.is_stub(): type_meta.write_type_def(buffer) writing_type_defs = copy(schema_consistent_type_def_stubs) Meta share mode: the writing steps are same as the normal mode, but captured_type_defs will be shared across multiple serializations of different objects. For example, suppose we have a batch to serialize: captured_type_defs = {} stream = ... # add `Type1` to `captured_type_defs` and write `Type1` fury.serialize(stream, [Type1()]) # add `Type2` to `captured_type_defs` and write `Type2`, `Type1` is written before. fury.serialize(stream, [Type1(), Type2()]) # `Type1` and `Type2` are written before, no need to write meta. fury.serialize(stream, [Type1(), Type2()]) Streaming mode(streaming mode doesn't support meta share): If type meta hasn't been written before, the data will be written as: | unsigned varint: 0b11111111 | type def | If type meta has been written before, the data will be written as: | unsigned varint: written index &lt;&lt; 1 | written index is the id in captured_type_defs.With this mode, meta start offset can be omitted.  The normal mode and meta share mode will forbid streaming writing since it needs to look back for update the start offset after the whole object graph writing and meta collecting is finished. Only in this way we can ensure deserialization failure in meta share mode doesn't lost shared meta.  Type Def​  Here we mainly describe the meta layout for schema evolution mode:  | 8 bytes meta header | variable bytes | variable bytes | variable bytes | +-------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+----------------+ | 7 bytes hash + 1 bytes header | current type meta | parent type meta | ... |   Type meta are encoded from parent type to leaf type, only type with serializable fields will be encoded.

Lowest 4 digits 0b0000~0b1110 are used to record num classes. 0b1111 is preserved to indicate that Fury need to read more bytes for length using Fury unsigned int encoding. If current type doesn't has parent type, or parent type doesn't have fields to serialize, or we're in a context which serialize fields of current type only, num classes will be 1.The 5th bit is used to indicate whether this type needs schema evolution.Other 56 bits are used to store the unique hash of flags + all layers type meta.  Single layer type meta​  | unsigned varint | var uint | field info: variable bytes | variable bytes | ... | +-----------------+----------+-------------------------------+-----------------+-----+ | num_fields | type id | header + type id + field name | next field info | ... |   num fields: encode num fields as unsigned varint. If the current type is schema consistent, then num_fields will be 0 to flag it.If the current type isn't schema consistent, then num_fields will be the number of compatible fields. For example, users can use tag id to mark some fields as compatible fields in schema consistent context. In such cases, schema consistent fields will be serialized first, then compatible fields will be serialized next. At deserialization, Fury will use fields info of those fields which aren't annotated by tag id for deserializing schema consistent fields, then use fields info in meta for deserializing compatible fields. type id: the registered id for the current type, which will be written as an unsigned varint.field info: header(8 bits): 3 bits size + 2 bits field name encoding + polymorphism flag + nullability flag + ref tracking flag. Users can use annotation to provide those info. 2 bits field name encoding: encoding: UTF8/ALL_TO_LOWER_SPECIAL/LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL/TAG_IDIf tag id is used, i.e. field name is written by an unsigned varint tag id. 2 bits encoding will be 11. size of field name: The 3 bits size: 0~7 will be used to indicate length 1~7, the value 7 indicates to read more bytes, the encoding will encode size - 7 as a varint next.If encoding is TAG_ID, then num_bytes of field name will be used to store tag id. ref tracking: when set to 1, ref tracking will be enabled for this field.nullability: when set to 1, this field can be null.polymorphism: when set to 1, the actual type of field will be the declared field type even the type if not final. field name: If tag id is set, tag id will be used instead. Otherwise meta string encoding [length] and data will be written instead.type id: For registered type-consistent classes, it will be the registered type id.Otherwise it will be encoded as OBJECT_ID if it isn't final and FINAL_OBJECT_ID if it's final. The meta for such types is written separately instead of inlining here is to reduce meta space cost if object of this type is serialized in current object graph multiple times, and the field value may be null too.  Field order are left as implementation details, which is not exposed to specification, the deserialization need to resort fields based on Fury field comparator. In this way, fury can compute statistics for field names or types and using a more compact encoding.  Other layers type meta​  Same encoding algorithm as the previous layer.

And most map size are smaller than 255, if all pairs have same data, the chunk will be 1. This is common in golang/rust, which object are not reference by default.  Also, if only one or two keys have different meta, we can make it into a different chunk, so that most pairs can share meta.  The implementation can accumulate read count with map size to decide whether to read more chunks.

The deserializer will compare this meta with class meta in the current process, and use the diff to determine how to deserialize the data.  For java/javascript/python, we can use the diff to generate serializer code at runtime and load it as class/function for deserialization. In this way, the type evolution will be as fast as type consist mode.  For C++/Rust, we can't generate the serializer code at runtime. So we need to generate the code at compile-time using meta programming. But at that time, we don't know the type schema in other processes, so we can't generate the serializer code for such inconsistent types. We may need to generate the code which has a loop and compare field name one by one to decide whether to deserialize and assign the field or skip the field value.  One fast way is that we can optimize the string comparison into jump instructions:  Assume the current type has n fields, and the peer type has n1 fields.Generate an auto growing field id from 0 for every sorted field in the current type at the compile time.Compare the received type meta with current type, generate same id if the field name is same, otherwise generate an auto growing id starting from n, cache this meta at runtime.Iterate the fields of received type meta, use a switch to compare the field id to deserialize data and assign/skip field value. Continuous field id will be optimized into jump in switch block, so it will very fast.  Here is an example, suppose process A has a class Foo with version 1 defined as Foo1, process B has a class Foowith version 2 defined as Foo2:  // class Foo with version 1 class Foo1 { int32_t v1; // id 0 std::string v2; // id 1 }; // class Foo with version 2 class Foo2 { // id 0, but will have id 2 in process A bool v0; // id 1, but will have id 0 in process A int32_t v1; // id 2, but will have id 3 in process A int64_t long_value; // id 3, but will have id 1 in process A std::string v2; // id 4, but will have id 4 in process A std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; list; };   When process A received serialized Foo2 from process B, here is how it deserialize the data:  Foo1 foo1 = ...; const std::vector&lt;fury::FieldInfo&gt; &amp;field_infos = type_meta.field_infos; for (const auto &amp;field_info : field_infos) { switch (field_info.field_id) { case 0: foo1.v1 = buffer.read_varint32(); break; case 1: foo1.v2 = fury.read_string(); break; default: fury.skip_data(field_info); } }  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Xlang Serialization Guide","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/guide/xlang_object_graph_guide","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Cross-language object graph serialization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Xlang Serialization Guide","url":"/docs/guide/xlang_object_graph_guide#cross-language-object-graph-serialization","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Serialize built-in types​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Xlang Serialization Guide","url":"/docs/guide/xlang_object_graph_guide#serialize-built-in-types","content":" Common types can be serialized automatically: primitive numeric types, string, binary, array, list, map and so on.
